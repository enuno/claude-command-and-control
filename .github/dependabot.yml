# - Commits follow Conventional Commits format
# - PRs assigned to repository maintainer

# Maintenance Notes:
# - Review and merge Dependabot PRs weekly
# - Check for breaking changes in major version updates
# - Monitor CI/CD pipeline after merging dependency updates
# - Update this configuration when new package ecosystems are added
