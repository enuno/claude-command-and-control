## Recommended Monitoring

Even though no files are stale, consider these proactive quality checks:

### 1. Content Accuracy Review (Optional)

Recent file modifications don't necessarily mean content is accurate. Consider periodic reviews:

```bash
# Review core documentation for accuracy
- [ ] docs/best-practices/*.md - Verify examples work with current Claude version
- [ ] templates/agents/*.md - Validate against latest agent configuration standards
- [ ] templates/commands/*.md - Test command syntax and permissions
- [ ] templates/skills/*.md - Verify workflow patterns are current
```

### 2. Functional Testing (Optional)

Test that commands and skills actually work:

```bash
# Test sample commands
/start-session    # Verify session initialization works
/test-all         # Check test execution
/docs             # Validate documentation generation

# Test agent templates by creating instances
# Test skills by loading and executing workflows
```

### 3. External Dependencies Check

Verify references to external resources:

```bash
- [ ] Check links in README.md for validity
- [ ] Verify Claude API documentation references are current
- [ ] Validate example code against latest library versions
- [ ] Review references to Anthropic documentation
```

## Next Steps

2. **Schedule Next Scan**: Run `/maintenance-scan` on **2026-02-21** (30 days from now)

3. **Optional Quality Review**: While files are fresh, consider content accuracy audits:
   ```bash
   # Pick a category to review each week:
   Week 1: Review command templates
   Week 2: Review agent templates
   Week 3: Review skill templates
   Week 4: Review best practice documentation
   ```

4. **Monitor Git Activity**: Keep tracking commits for insight into what's being actively maintained
