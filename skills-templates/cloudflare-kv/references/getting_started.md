## Purpose

The purpose of a how to is to explain how to complete a task within the product.

Note

If you are unsure about when to categorize something as a how-to or tutorial, remember:

Tutorials are typically longer form and contain multiple steps, usually involving multiple products, and help users connect products to real-world scenarios.

A how-to helps a user complete a singular task within a single product.

## Tone

instructional, straightforward

## content\_type
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown

## Structure

### Required components

[**Title**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/titles/): Short verb phrase in second-person imperative. Do not use gerund phrases.

[**Steps**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/): Numbered steps that complete a task.

[**Next steps**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/next-steps/): What users should see as the end result of the steps and/or actionable next steps.

### Optional components

[**Context**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/context/): An introductory paragraph on the following steps and what they will accomplish.

Provide context to the reader that is not in the section heading.

End with a colon or a period. Use a colon if it immediately precedes the steps. Use a period if there is more material (such as a note) between the context and the procedure.

Do not provide context for steps with a partial sentence that is completed by the numbered steps.

[**Prerequisites**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/prerequisites/): Tasks or conditions that must be completed before a user can complete a series of steps.
