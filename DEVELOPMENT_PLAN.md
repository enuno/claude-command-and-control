## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **gRPC compatibility** | Can't talk to miners | Medium | Weekly test with real hardware |
| **Firmware timeout** | Updates fail | High | Implement 45min timeout with rollback |
| **Multi-tenant isolation** | Data leak | Low | Mandatory security review + tests |
| **Cache invalidation bugs** | Stale data served | Medium | Comprehensive test coverage + monitoring |
| **Performance under load** | Response timeouts | Medium | Load testing in week 9 |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **gRPC Compatibility:** Weekly validation against latest Braiins API
2. **Firmware Updates:** Comprehensive testing with mock delayed responses
3. **Security:** Mandatory review before auth merge, penetration testing
4. **Cache:** Unit tests for every cache operation, monitoring
5. **Performance:** Load test by week 9, scale if needed
