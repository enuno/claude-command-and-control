# Reference Snippets (Internal)

This folder contains **copyable reference code** intended to be used by agents while executing skills.

These snippets are intentionally:
- **Not runnable apps** (use `templates/` for runnable projects)
- **Not a user-facing API** (no backwards-compat guarantees)

## Available snippet sets

- `product-starter/` — Supabase + Stripe + credits + R2/S3-compatible storage helpers
