## Star Rating System

### Element Strength Ratings

| Rating | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ★★★★★ | **Excellent** | Overwhelming evidence, no significant weaknesses |
| ★★★★☆ | **Strong** | Solid evidence, minor weaknesses |
| ★★★☆☆ | **Moderate** | Decent evidence, some weaknesses or disputes |
| ★★☆☆☆ | **Weak** | Marginal evidence, significant weaknesses |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | **Very Weak** | Insufficient evidence, element likely fails |

### Overall Claim Ratings

| Rating | Recommendation | Likelihood of Success |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| ★★★★★ | **Pursue** | High (>70%) |
| ★★★★☆ | **Pursue** | Good (50-70%) |
| ★★★☆☆ | **Conditional** | Moderate (30-50%) - pursue if additional evidence |
| ★★☆☆☆ | **Reconsider** | Low (10-30%) - significant risks |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | **Decline** | Very Low (<10%) - insurmountable issues |

## Example Workflow

### Case Example: Police Excessive Force

**Facts**: Officer tased handcuffed suspect during traffic stop

**Step 1**: Select `1983-excessive-force.md`

**Step 2**: Complete elements

**Element 1: Seizure**
- [x] Arrest occurred (traffic stop + handcuffs)
- Evidence: Body camera footage, officer report
- **Rating**: ★★★★★ (clearly satisfied)

**Element 2: Color of State Law**
- [x] Defendant was on-duty police officer
- Evidence: Uniform, badge, official police report
- **Rating**: ★★★★★ (clearly satisfied)

**Element 3: Objectively Unreasonable Force**
- Graham Factor 1 (Crime Severity): Traffic violation (★☆☆☆☆ - minimal)
- Graham Factor 2 (Threat): Handcuffed, no weapon (★☆☆☆☆ - no threat)
- Graham Factor 3 (Resistance): No resistance (★☆☆☆☆ - fully compliant)
- Force Used: Taser (★★★★★ - significant force)
- **Conclusion**: Force objectively unreasonable
- **Rating**: ★★★★★ (strong evidence of unreasonableness)

**Element 4: Injury**
- [x] Taser burns, pain
- Evidence: Emergency room records, photographs
- **Rating**: ★★★★☆ (clear but not severe injury)

**Element 5: Causation**
- [x] Injury directly from taser
- **Rating**: ★★★★★ (direct causation)

**Qualified Immunity**
- Clearly established: *Bryan v. MacPherson* (9th Cir. 2010) - taser on non-resisting, handcuffed suspect excessive
- **Conclusion**: QI likely overcome
- **Rating**: ★★★★☆

**Step 3**: Overall Assessment
- **Claim Strength**: ★★★★★ (Strong)
- **Recommendation**: **Pursue** - high likelihood of success

**Step 4**: Document
- Add analysis to CASE_ANALYSIS.md
- Plan discovery: Request officer training records, prior taser incidents
- Prepare for settlement negotiations or trial

## Tips for Effective Use

### 1. Be Honest About Weaknesses

**Don't Overstate**: Objective analysis more valuable than wishful thinking
- If element weak, note it clearly
- Identify what evidence would strengthen it
- Don't proceed with unviable claims

### 2. Document Evidence Precisely

**Be Specific**:
- ❌ "Plaintiff injured" (vague)
- ✅ "Plaintiff suffered taser burns to chest and abdomen, photographed in ER records dated 1/15/26" (specific)

### 3. Update as Discovery Progresses

**Living Document**: Revisit checklist after:
- Depositions
- Expert reports
- Document production
- New evidence discovered

### 4. Use for Discovery Planning

**Identify Gaps**: Each weak element → discovery target
- ★★☆☆☆ rating → What evidence needed to strengthen?
- Missing evidence → What requests/depositions?

### 5. Compare to Settlement Leverage

**Settlement Analysis**:
- All ★★★★★ elements → Strong settlement position
- Mix of ★★★☆☆ → Moderate settlement value
- Multiple ★★☆☆☆ → Weak settlement position

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Confirmation Bias

**Pitfall**: Seeing only evidence supporting claim, ignoring weaknesses

**Solution**: Actively seek contrary evidence; consider defendant's best arguments

### 2. Skipping Elements

**Pitfall**: Assuming element satisfied without analysis

**Solution**: Complete EVERY element, even if seems obvious

### 3. Ignoring Defenses

**Pitfall**: Focusing only on elements, not on defenses (qualified immunity, comparative negligence)

**Solution**: Complete defense analysis sections thoroughly

### 4. Static Analysis

**Pitfall**: Completing checklist once and never updating

**Solution**: Revisit after each major discovery event

## Customization

### Creating New Checklists

To create checklist for new claim type:

1. **Copy template structure** from existing checklist
2. **Research elements** from case law and statutes
3. **Identify common evidence** for each element
4. **Add defense analysis** specific to claim
5. **Include case law references** for key issues
6. **Test on real cases** and refine

### Adapting for Jurisdiction

**State-Specific Variations**:
- Check local case law for element variations
- Verify defenses (comparative negligence rules vary)
- Note procedural differences (statute of limitations, notice requirements)
