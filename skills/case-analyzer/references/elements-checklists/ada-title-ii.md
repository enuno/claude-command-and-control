## Strategic Considerations

### Combining ADA with § 1983

**Common Strategy**: Plead both ADA Title II and § 1983 (Equal Protection/Due Process)

**Advantages**:
- § 1983: No "otherwise qualified" requirement, potential for punitive damages
- ADA: No qualified immunity, specific disability protections

**Example Pleading**:
```
Count I: ADA Title II - Denial of Access
Count II: § 1983 - Equal Protection (disability discrimination)
Count III: § 1983 - Due Process (if liberty/property interest)
```

---

### Administrative Exhaustion

**NOT REQUIRED**: Unlike employment (Title I), ADA Title II does NOT require administrative filing before lawsuit

**Can Sue Directly** in federal court
