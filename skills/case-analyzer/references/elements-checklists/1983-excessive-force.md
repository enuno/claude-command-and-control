## Qualified Immunity Analysis

### Step 1: Constitutional Violation?

Based on elements analysis above, did defendant violate Fourth Amendment?

- [ ] **Yes** - Force was objectively unreasonable
- [ ] **No** - Force was objectively reasonable
- [ ] **Disputed** - Genuine fact dispute

**If YES or DISPUTED, proceed to Step 2**

---

### Step 2: Clearly Established Right?

**Question**: Was it clearly established at time of violation that defendant's conduct was unconstitutional?

**Applicable Precedent**:

| Case | Citation | Facts | Similarity |
|------|----------|-------|------------|
| 1. | | | [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low |
| 2. | | | [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low |
| 3. | | | [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low |

**Supreme Court Precedent**:
- [ ] *Graham v. Connor* (objective reasonableness standard)
- [ ] *Tennessee v. Garner* (deadly force against fleeing suspect)

- [ ] **Novel**: No prior case addressing this conduct

**"Obvious Case" Argument**:
- [ ] Conduct so obviously unconstitutional that no precedent needed
  - Rationale: _______________________

### Qualified Immunity Conclusion

- [ ] **QI Likely Denied** - Right clearly established
- [ ] **QI Likely Granted** - Right not clearly established
