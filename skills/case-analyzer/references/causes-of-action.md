## Usage Notes

### Claim Selection Strategy

1. **Lead with strongest federal claim** (typically § 1983)
2. **Add pendant state law claims** under supplemental jurisdiction
3. **Consider strategic advantages**:
   - Federal: Attorney's fees available, broader discovery, jury pools
   - State: Potentially higher damages, different SOL, local venue

### Pleading Multiple Claims

**Allowed**: Plead alternative and inconsistent theories

**Example**:
- Count I: § 1983 Excessive Force
- Count II: § 1983 Failure to Intervene
- Count III: State Law Battery
- Count IV: State Law Negligent Supervision
- Count V: Monell Liability (Failure to Train)

### Statute of Limitations Planning

- **Calculate from date of injury** (accrual varies by claim)
- **Discovery rule exceptions** (limited applicability)
- **Tolling for minors/incompetents** (state-specific)
- **Federal vs. state SOL** (§ 1983 borrows state personal injury SOL)
