## Intentional Torts Against the Person

### Assault

#### Elements

1. **Intent**: Defendant intended to cause harmful/offensive contact OR apprehension thereof
2. **Apprehension**: Plaintiff placed in **imminent** apprehension of harmful/offensive contact
3. **Reasonable Apprehension**: Apprehension was reasonable under circumstances
4. **No Consent**: Plaintiff did not consent

#### Key Concepts

**Imminent**: Right now, not future threat
- ✅ "I'm going to punch you" + raised fist = assault
- ❌ "I'm going to punch you tomorrow" = NOT assault (no imminence)

**Apprehension vs. Fear**: Need not be afraid, just aware of imminent contact

**Words Alone**: Generally insufficient absent overt act
- Exception: Words + circumstances creating reasonable apprehension

#### Common Applications in Civil Rights Cases

**Police Misconduct Examples**:
- Officer pointing firearm at unarmed, compliant person
- Officer raising baton in threatening manner
- Officer reaching for weapon while making threats

**Evidence to Gather**:
- Witness testimony about defendant's actions
- Video/audio recording
- Plaintiff's contemporaneous statements showing fear
- Medical evidence of stress response (elevated heart rate, etc.)

#### Damages

**Compensatory**:
- Emotional distress
- Mental anguish
- Medical treatment for psychological injury

**Punitive**: Available if conduct was malicious, willful, or reckless

#### Defenses

- **Consent**: Plaintiff agreed to contact (boxing match, medical procedure)
- **Self-Defense**: Reasonable response to threat
- **Defense of Others**: Reasonable belief third party in danger
- **Privilege**: Law enforcement officer acting lawfully

- Refusal to release plaintiff's property (purse, car keys)

**Bounded Area**: Plaintiff must be unable to escape
- Must be no reasonable means of escape known to plaintiff
- Escape need not be risk-free

**Temporal Duration**: Can be brief (minutes sufficient)

#### False Arrest vs. False Imprisonment

**False Arrest**: Subset of false imprisonment involving unlawful arrest by officer

**Elements of False Arrest**:
1. Arrest occurred
2. Arrest was without legal authority (no probable cause OR invalid warrant)

#### Common Applications

- Detained in reasonable manner
- For reasonable time (investigation)
- On premises or immediate vicinity

**Citizen's Arrest** (Where Authorized):
- Felony actually committed
- Reasonable belief defendant committed it

**Parental Authority**: Parent's right to confine child (within limits)

### Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)

#### Elements

1. **Extreme and Outrageous Conduct**: Exceeds all bounds of decency
2. **Intent or Recklessness**: Defendant intended to cause distress OR recklessly disregarded probability
3. **Severe Emotional Distress**: Plaintiff suffered severe distress
4. **Causation**: Defendant's conduct caused distress

#### Key Concepts

**Extreme and Outrageous Standard**:
- "Conduct so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community" (*Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46*)

**Examples of Outrageous Conduct**:
- ✅ Falsely telling parent their child died
- ✅ Prolonged campaign of harassment/threats
- ✅ Racial epithets + physical threats by officer
- ❌ Rude behavior, insults (generally insufficient)
- ❌ Single incident of wrongful termination

**Special Relationships**: Lower threshold for outrageous where:
- Common carrier & passenger
- Innkeeper & guest
- **Public utility & customer**
- **Police officer & citizen** (some jurisdictions)

#### Common Applications

**Police Misconduct**:
- Threatening family members to coerce confession
- Deliberately taunting arrestee with racial slurs
- Prolonged psychological abuse during interrogation
- Deliberately causing parent to witness child's mistreatment

**Institutional**:
- Prison officials allowing sexual assault
- Deliberate indifference to suicide risk with taunting
- Forcing victim to view traumatic evidence repeatedly

**Employment** (Rare Success):
- Generally, wrongful termination alone insufficient
- Exception: Particularly humiliating manner + vulnerable employee

#### Damages

**Compensatory**:
- Emotional distress
- Medical expenses (therapy, medication)
- Physical manifestations (stress-related illness)

**Proof of Distress**:
- Medical/psychological records
- Expert testimony
- Lay testimony about behavior changes
- Physical symptoms (ulcers, insomnia, etc.)

**Punitive**: Available if conduct malicious

#### Defenses

**Not Outrageous**: Most common defense
- Mere insults, indignities insufficient
- Defendant's conduct must truly "shock the conscience"

**No Severe Distress**: Plaintiff's distress not severe enough
- "Mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger" insufficient
- Typically requires medical/psychological treatment

**Privilege**:
- First Amendment (speech protection)
- Litigation privilege (statements in court)

#### Practice Tips

**High Bar for Success**: IIED claims difficult to win
- Courts dismiss many IIED claims as insufficient
- Best used as backup claim to other torts

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Detailed factual allegations of conduct
- Medical records showing treatment
- Expert testimony on psychological impact
- Contemporaneous documentation (diary, emails)

**State Variations**:
- Some states require physical injury/symptoms
- Some reject IIED as duplicative of other claims
- Third-party IIED (bystander) varies widely

## Negligence

### Elements

1. **Duty**: Defendant owed plaintiff duty of care
2. **Breach**: Defendant breached that duty
3. **Causation**: Breach was actual and proximate cause of injury
4. **Damages**: Plaintiff suffered actual damages

### Element 1: Duty of Care

#### General Duty Rule

**Reasonable Person Standard**: Duty to act as reasonably prudent person under circumstances

**Forseeability Test**: Duty owed if injury was foreseeable

#### Special Duty Rules

**No Duty to Rescue** (General Rule):
- No duty to aid stranger in peril
- Exception: Special relationship (parent-child, carrier-passenger, **custodian-prisoner**)

**Police Duty** (*DeShaney v. Winnebago County*, 489 U.S. 189 (1989)):
- Generally **no constitutional duty** to protect from private violence
- Exception: State-created danger doctrine (some circuits)
- State tort law may impose statutory duty

**Municipal Immunity**: Many states immunize municipalities for discretionary acts

**Duties in Civil Rights Context**:
- **Duty to provide medical care** (prisoners, arrestees)
- **Duty to train employees** (employers)
- **Duty to supervise** (employers, schools)

### Element 2: Breach of Duty

**Standard**: Defendant failed to act as reasonable person

**Factors**:
- Probability of harm
- Severity of harm
- Burden of precautions
- Social utility of conduct

**Proof Methods**:
- Direct evidence of conduct
- Violation of statute (negligence per se)
- Expert testimony on standard of care
- Res ipsa loquitur (inference from circumstances)

### Element 3: Causation

#### Actual Cause (Cause-in-Fact)

**But-For Test**: But for defendant's conduct, injury would not have occurred

**Substantial Factor Test** (Multiple Causes): Defendant's conduct was substantial factor

#### Proximate Cause (Legal Cause)

**Forseeability**: Injury must be foreseeable consequence

**Intervening Causes**: May break causal chain if:
- Unforeseeable
- Superseding (independent of original negligence)

### Element 4: Damages

**Actual Injury Required**: Unlike intentional torts, no damages = no claim

**Types of Damages**:
- Economic (medical expenses, lost wages, property damage)
- Non-economic (pain and suffering, emotional distress)

### Common Negligence Claims in Civil Rights Cases

#### Negligent Hiring

**Elements**:
1. Employer hired employee
2. Employee was unfit/incompetent
3. Employer knew or should have known of unfitness
4. Unfitness proximately caused plaintiff's injury

**Application to Police**:
- Hiring officer with history of violence
- Failing to conduct background check
- Ignoring red flags in hiring process

**Evidence Needed**:
- Hiring records
- Background check (or lack thereof)
- Prior misconduct at previous departments
- Employer's knowledge (interview notes, etc.)

#### Negligent Retention

**Elements**:
1. Employee proved unfit during employment
2. Employer knew or should have known
3. Employer retained employee
4. Retention proximately caused injury

**Application to Police**:

- Complaint history
- Discipline records (or lack thereof)
- Internal affairs investigations

#### Negligent Supervision

**Elements**:

2. Employer breached duty (inadequate supervision)
3. Breach proximately caused injury

**Examples**:
- Failure to monitor officer with pattern of complaints
- Inadequate oversight of high-risk operations

#### Negligent Training

**Overlap with § 1983**: Also basis for Monell claim (*City of Canton v. Harris*)

**Elements**:
1. Training deficiency existed
2. Deficiency created foreseeable risk
3. Deficiency caused plaintiff's injury

**Examples**:
- No de-escalation training
- Inadequate use-of-force training
- No training on interacting with mentally ill

### Defenses to Negligence

#### Contributory Negligence (5 States Only)

**Rule**: Any negligence by plaintiff bars recovery

**States**: Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington D.C.

**Harsh Result**: Even 1% fault = no recovery

#### Comparative Negligence (Most States)

**Pure Comparative Negligence** (13 States):
- Plaintiff's recovery reduced by percentage of fault
- Can recover even if 99% at fault

**Modified Comparative Negligence** (33 States):
- **50% Bar**: Can recover if ≤50% at fault (some states <50%)
- **51% Bar**: Can recover if <51% at fault
- Most common rule

**Effect**: Damages reduced proportionally

**Example**:
```
Plaintiff's damages: $100,000
Plaintiff's fault: 30%
Recovery: $70,000 (100,000 × 70%)
```

#### Assumption of Risk

**Express**: Plaintiff contractually agreed to assume risk (waiver)

**Implied**: Plaintiff voluntarily encountered known risk

**Modern Trend**: Merged with comparative negligence in many states

#### Governmental Immunity

**Federal Tort Claims Act** (FTCA):
- Waives federal sovereign immunity with exceptions
- **Discretionary Function Exception**: No liability for policy decisions
- **Law Enforcement Exception**: Often bars claims from arrests, investigations

**State Tort Claims Acts**: Vary widely
- Most require notice to government entity (30-180 days)

- Many immunize discretionary acts

**Municipalities**:
- Generally liable for ministerial acts (routine tasks)
- Often immune for discretionary acts (policy decisions)

## Wrongful Death and Survival Actions

### Wrongful Death

#### Statutory Basis

**State Statute Required**: No common law wrongful death action

**Typical Citation**: "[State] Wrongful Death Act"

#### Elements

1. **Death**: Decedent died
2. **Wrongful Act**: Death caused by defendant's wrongful act, neglect, or default
3. **Defendant Liable**: Defendant would be liable if decedent had lived
4. **Statutory Beneficiaries**: Plaintiff is statutory beneficiary

#### Who May Sue

**Varies by State**:
- **Most States**: Spouse, children, parents (in that order)

- Funeral and burial expenses
- (Some states) Medical expenses before death

**Non-Pecuniary Losses** (Many States):
- Loss of companionship/consortium

- Grief and mental anguish

**Punitive Damages**: Allowed in some states for wrongful death

**State Variations**:

---

### Survival Action

#### Purpose

Allows estate to recover for decedent's injuries before death (what decedent could have recovered if alive)

#### Elements

1. Decedent had valid claim at time of death
2. Claim survives under state law (not all do)
3. Plaintiff is proper representative

#### Who May Sue

**Personal Representative** of estate (executor/administrator)

#### Damages Recoverable

**Pre-Death Injuries**:
- Medical expenses incurred before death
- Pain and suffering before death
- Lost wages/earning capacity before death
- Property damage

**Punitive Damages**: Survive in most states (check statute)

#### Survival vs. Wrongful Death

| Issue | Survival Action | Wrongful Death |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **What's Recovered** | Decedent's losses before death | Survivors' losses from death |
| **Who Sues** | Estate/personal representative | Statutory beneficiaries |
| **Damages** | Pain/suffering, medical, lost wages | Loss of support, companionship |
| **SOL Accrual** | Date of injury | Date of death |

**Both May Be Pled**: Commonly pled together

**Example**:
```
Decedent shot by police, survived 2 days in hospital, then died

Survival Action Damages:
  - Medical expenses: $50,000
  - Pain and suffering (2 days): $100,000
  - Lost wages (2 days): $500

Wrongful Death Damages:
  - Loss of financial support (30 years): $2,000,000
  - Loss of companionship: $500,000
  - Funeral expenses: $15,000

Total Recovery: $2,665,500
```

## Vicarious Liability

### Respondeat Superior

**Rule**: Employer liable for employee's torts committed within scope of employment

**Elements**:
1. **Employment Relationship**: Master-servant (not independent contractor)
2. **Scope of Employment**: Tort occurred during employment
3. **Furthering Employer's Business**: Even if prohibited conduct

**Scope of Employment Factors**:
- Time (during work hours?)
- Place (at workplace or work-related location?)
- Purpose (furthering employer's business?)
- Authorized conduct (or incidental to authorized conduct?)

**Examples - Within Scope**:
- Delivery driver causes accident on delivery route
- Security guard uses excessive force detaining shoplifter
- Officer makes arrest (even if wrongful)

**Examples - Outside Scope**:
- Employee commits crime for purely personal reasons
- Officer acts in purely private capacity (moonlighting)
- Intentional tort unrelated to employment

**Intentional Torts**: Generally outside scope UNLESS:
- Furthering employer's business
- Natural from nature of employment
- Employer authorized or ratified

### Joint and Several Liability

**Rule** (Traditional): Each defendant liable for entire judgment; plaintiff may collect from any defendant

**Modern Trend**: Many states modified rule
- **Several Liability**: Defendant liable only for percentage of fault
- **Hybrid**: Joint for economic damages, several for non-economic

**Strategic Impact**: Affects settlement leverage

---

## Damages Considerations

### Compensatory Damages

#### Economic Damages

**Past Economic Losses**:
- Medical expenses incurred
- Lost wages to date
- Property damage

**Future Economic Losses**:
- Future medical expenses
- Future lost earning capacity
- Future care costs

**Proof Requirements**:
- Expert testimony (economist, vocational expert, medical expert)
- Life care plan (for severe injuries)
- Present value calculation (future losses)

#### Non-Economic Damages

**Categories**:
- Pain and suffering
- Emotional distress
- Loss of enjoyment of life
- Disfigurement
- Physical impairment

**No Objective Measure**: Jury discretion with guidance

**Caps**: Many states cap non-economic damages
- **Medical Malpractice**: $250K-$1M caps common
- **General Tort**: Some states cap ($500K typical)
- **Wrongful Death**: Some states cap

### Punitive Damages

#### Purpose

- Punish defendant
- Deter future misconduct
- Express societal condemnation

#### Standard

**Varies by State**:
- **Clear and Convincing Evidence** (most states)
- **Preponderance** (minority)

**Conduct Required**:
- Malicious, willful, wanton, reckless
- Fraud, oppression, or malice
- Conscious disregard for rights/safety

#### Constitutional Limits

**Due Process** (*BMW v. Gore*, *State Farm v. Campbell*):

1. **Reprehensibility**: How reprehensible was conduct?
   - Physical harm vs. economic
   - Indifference to safety
   - Vulnerable victim
   - Repeated conduct

2. **Ratio**: Punitive to compensatory damages
   - **Single-digit ratios** generally constitutional
   - **1:1 to 4:1**: Presumptively reasonable
   - **10:1 or more**: Likely unconstitutional

3. **Comparable Penalties**: Civil and criminal penalties for similar conduct

#### State Caps on Punitive Damages

**No Cap** (Minority): Unlimited punitive damages

**Ratio Caps**: 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 most common

**Fixed Caps**: $250K, $500K, etc.

**Bifurcated Trial**: Some states require separate trial phase for punitives

#### Award Distribution

**State Takes Portion** (Some States):
- 50% to state, 50% to plaintiff
- 75% to state, 25% to plaintiff
- Intended to reduce "windfall" to plaintiffs

---

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Plead State Torts Alongside § 1983

**Advantages**:
- No qualified immunity for state torts
- Potential for higher damages (pain/suffering)
- Jury may be more familiar with tort concepts
- Backup if § 1983 fails

**Disadvantages**:
- Governmental immunity may apply
- Shorter statute of limitations (sometimes)
- Damages caps in some states

### Supplemental Jurisdiction

**28 U.S.C. § 1367**: Federal courts have supplemental jurisdiction over state claims arising from same case or controversy

**Practical Effect**: Can plead federal (§ 1983) and state claims in same lawsuit

**Discretionary Dismissal**: Court may decline supplemental jurisdiction if:
- State law claims predominate
- Federal claims dismissed
- Exceptional circumstances

### Settlement Dynamics

**Joint Settlement**: Often negotiate package deal for all claims

**Comparative Value**:
- § 1983: Attorney's fees shift
- State tort: No fee shift (unless statute)
- Consider likely recovery on each claim
