# About custom domains and GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages supports using custom domains, or changing the root of your site's URL from the default, like `octocat.github.io`, to any domain you own.

## Supported custom domains

> \[!TIP]
> We recommend verifying your custom domain prior to adding it to your repository, in order to improve security and avoid takeover attacks. For more information, see [Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages).

GitHub Pages works with two types of domains: subdomains and apex domains. For a list of unsupported custom domains, see [Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages#custom-domain-names-that-are-unsupported).

| Supported custom domain type | Example            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `www` subdomain              | `www.example.com`  |
| Custom subdomain             | `blog.example.com` |
| Apex domain                  | `example.com`      |

You can set up either or both of apex and `www` subdomain configurations for your site. For more information on apex domains, see [Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site](#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

We recommend always using a `www` subdomain, even if you also use an apex domain. When you create a new site with an apex domain, we automatically attempt to secure the `www` subdomain for use when serving your site's content, but you need to make the DNS changes to use the `www` subdomain. If you configure a `www` subdomain, we automatically attempt to secure the associated apex domain. For more information, see [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Using a custom domain across multiple repositories

If you set a custom domain for a user or organization site, by default, the same custom domain will be used for all project sites owned by the same account. For more information about site types, see [What is GitHub Pages?](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).

For example, if the custom domain for your user site is `www.octocat.com`, and you have a project site with no custom domain configured that is published from a repository called `octo-project`, the GitHub Pages site for that repository will be available at `www.octocat.com/octo-project`.

You can override the default custom domain by adding a custom domain to the individual repository.

> \[!NOTE]
> The URLs for project sites that are privately published are not affected by the custom domain for your user or organization site. For more information about privately published sites, see [Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

To remove the default custom domain, you must remove the custom domain from your user or organization site.

## Using a subdomain for your GitHub Pages site

A subdomain is the part of a URL before the root domain. You can configure your subdomain as `www` or as a distinct section of your site, like `blog.example.com`.

Subdomains are configured with a `CNAME` record through your DNS provider. For more information, see [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain).

### `www` subdomains

A `www` subdomain is the most commonly used type of subdomain. For example, `www.example.com` includes a `www` subdomain.

`www` subdomains are the most stable type of custom domain because `www` subdomains are not affected by changes to the IP addresses of GitHub's servers.

### Custom subdomains

A custom subdomain is a type of subdomain that doesn't use the standard `www` variant. Custom subdomains are mostly used when you want two distinct sections of your site. For example, you can create a site called `blog.example.com` and customize that section independently from `www.example.com`.

## Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site

An apex domain is a custom domain that does not contain a subdomain, such as `example.com`. Apex domains are also known as base, bare, naked, root apex, or zone apex domains.

An apex domain is configured with an `A`, `ALIAS`, or `ANAME` record through your DNS provider. For more information, see [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain).

If you are using an apex domain as your custom domain, we recommend also setting up a `www` subdomain. If you configure the correct records for each domain type through your DNS provider, GitHub Pages will automatically create redirects between the domains. For example, if you configure `www.example.com` as the custom domain for your site, and you have GitHub Pages DNS records set up for the apex and `www` domains, then `example.com` will redirect to `www.example.com`. If you instead configure `example.com` as the custom domain, then `www.example.com` will redirect to `example.com`. Automatic redirects also apply to other subdomains, as `www.blog.example.com` will redirect to `blog.example.com` or vice versa. It is not possible to configure a domain that starts with `www.www.`. For more information, see [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain).

## Securing the custom domain for your GitHub Pages site

If your GitHub Pages site is disabled but has a custom domain set up, it is at risk of a domain takeover. Having a custom domain configured with your DNS provider while your site is disabled could result in someone else hosting a site on one of your subdomains.

Verifying your custom domain prevents other GitHub users from using your domain with their repositories. If your domain is not verified, and your GitHub Pages site is disabled, you should immediately update or remove your DNS records with your DNS provider. For more information, see [Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages) and [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

There are a couple of reasons your site might be automatically disabled.

* If you downgrade from GitHub Pro to GitHub Free, any GitHub Pages sites that are currently published from private repositories in your account will be unpublished. For more information, see [Downgrading your account's plan](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan).
* If you transfer a private repository to a personal account that is using GitHub Free, the repository will lose access to the GitHub Pages feature, and the currently published GitHub Pages site will be unpublished. For more information, see [Transferring a repository](/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository).

> You can set up or update certain DNS records and your repository settings to point the default domain for your GitHub Pages site to a custom domain.

# Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site

You can set up or update certain DNS records and your repository settings to point the default domain for your GitHub Pages site to a custom domain.

People with admin permissions for a repository can configure a custom domain for a GitHub Pages site.

## About custom domain configuration

> \[!TIP]
> We recommend verifying your custom domain prior to adding it to your repository, in order to improve security and avoid takeover attacks. For more information, see [Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages).

Make sure you add your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site before configuring your custom domain with your DNS provider. Configuring your custom domain with your DNS provider without adding your custom domain to GitHub could result in someone else being able to host a site on one of your subdomains.

<div class="ghd-tool windows">

The `dig` command, which can be used to verify correct configuration of DNS records, is not included in Windows. To verify that your DNS records are configured correctly, you can use the `Resolve-DnsName` PowerShell command or install [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/).

> \[!NOTE]
> DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate.

## Configuring an apex domain

To set up an apex domain, such as `example.com`, you must configure a custom domain in your repository settings and at least one `ALIAS`, `ANAME`, or `A` record with your DNS provider.

4. Under "Custom domain", type your custom domain, then click **Save**. If you are publishing your site from a branch, this will create a commit that adds a `CNAME` file directly to the root of your source branch. If you are publishing from a custom GitHub Actions workflow, no `CNAME` file is created, and any existing `CNAME` file is ignored and is not required. For more information about your publishing source, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
5. Navigate to your DNS provider and create either an `ALIAS`, `ANAME`, or `A` record. You can also create `AAAA` records for IPv6 support. If you're implementing IPv6 support, we highly recommend using an `A` record in addition to your `AAAA` record, due to slow adoption of IPv6 globally. For more information about how to create the correct record, see your DNS provider's documentation.
   * To create an `ALIAS` or `ANAME` record, point your apex domain to the default domain for your site. For more information about the default domain for your site, see [What is GitHub Pages?](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).

   * To create `A` records, point your apex domain to the IP addresses for GitHub Pages.

     ```shell
     185.199.108.153
     185.199.109.153
     185.199.110.153
     185.199.111.153
     ```

   * To create `AAAA` records, point your apex domain to the IP addresses for GitHub Pages.

     ```shell
     2606:50c0:8000::153
     2606:50c0:8001::153
     2606:50c0:8002::153
     2606:50c0:8003::153
     ```

> \[!NOTE]
> If your DNS provider automatically sets a default record, remove it before continuing.

> \[!WARNING]
> We strongly recommend that you do not use wildcard DNS records, such as `*.example.com`. These records put you at an immediate risk of domain takeovers, even if you verify the domain. For example, if you verify `example.com` this prevents someone from using `a.example.com` but they could still take over `b.a.example.com` (which is covered by the wildcard DNS record).

1. Open <span class="platform-mac">Terminal</span><span class="platform-linux">Terminal</span><span class="platform-windows">Git Bash</span>.

2. To confirm that your DNS record configured correctly, use the `dig` command, replacing *EXAMPLE.COM* with your apex domain. Confirm that the results match the IP addresses for GitHub Pages above.
   * For `A` records:

     ```shell
     $ dig EXAMPLE.COM +noall +answer -t A
     > EXAMPLE.COM    3600    IN A     185.199.108.153
     > EXAMPLE.COM    3600    IN A     185.199.109.153
     > EXAMPLE.COM    3600    IN A     185.199.110.153
     > EXAMPLE.COM    3600    IN A     185.199.111.153
     ```

   * For `AAAA` records:

     ```shell
     $ dig EXAMPLE.COM +noall +answer -t AAAA
     > EXAMPLE.COM     3600    IN AAAA     2606:50c0:8000::153
     > EXAMPLE.COM     3600    IN AAAA     2606:50c0:8001::153
     > EXAMPLE.COM     3600    IN AAAA     2606:50c0:8002::153
     > EXAMPLE.COM     3600    IN AAAA     2606:50c0:8003::153
     ```

3. If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the CNAME file to your local repository. For more information, see [Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages#cname-errors).

4. Optionally, to enforce HTTPS encryption for your site, select **Enforce HTTPS**. It can take up to 24 hours before this option is available. For more information, see [Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https).

### Configuring an apex domain and the `www` subdomain variant

> \[!NOTE]
> Setting up a `www` subdomain alongside an apex domain is recommended for HTTPS secured websites.

If you are using an apex domain as your custom domain, we recommend also setting up a `www` subdomain. If you configure the correct records for each domain type through your DNS provider, GitHub Pages will automatically create redirects between the domains. For example, if you configure `www.example.com` as the custom domain for your site, and you have GitHub Pages DNS records set up for the apex and `www` domains, then `example.com` will redirect to `www.example.com`. If you instead configure `example.com` as the custom domain, then `www.example.com` will redirect to `example.com`. Automatic redirects also apply to other subdomains, as `www.blog.example.com` will redirect to `blog.example.com` or vice versa. It is not possible to configure a domain that starts with `www.www.`. For more information, see [Configuring a subdomain](#configuring-a-subdomain).

Navigate to your DNS provider and create a `CNAME` record for the `www` subdomain that points to your GitHub Pages default domain. For example, if your site is located at `<user>.github.io`, you should create a `CNAME` record that points `www.example.com` to `<user>.github.io` Similarly, for an organization site located at `<organization>.github.io`, you should create a `CNAME` record that points `www.example.com` to `<organization>.github.io`. Ensure that the `CNAME` record points directly to `<user>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io` without including the repository name.

For more information about how to create the correct record, see your DNS provider's documentation. For more information about the default domain for your site, see [What is GitHub Pages?](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).

## Configuring a subdomain

To set up a `www` or custom subdomain, such as `www.example.com` or `blog.example.com`, you must add your domain in the repository settings. After that, configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider.

4. Under "Custom domain", type your custom domain, then click **Save**. If you are publishing your site from a branch, this will create a commit that adds a `CNAME` file directly to the root of your source branch. If you are publishing from a custom GitHub Actions workflow, no `CNAME` file is created, and any existing `CNAME` file is ignored and is not required. For more information about your publishing source, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

   > \[!NOTE]
   > If your custom domain is an internationalized domain name, you must enter the Punycode encoded version.
   >
   > For more information on Punycodes, see [Internationalized domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name).

5. Navigate to your DNS provider and create a `CNAME` record that points your subdomain to the default domain for your site. For example, if you want to use the subdomain `www.example.com` for your user site, create a `CNAME` record that points `www.example.com` to `<user>.github.io`. If you want to use the subdomain `another.example.com` for your organization site, create a `CNAME` record that points `another.example.com` to `<organization>.github.io`. The `CNAME` record should always point to `<user>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io`, excluding the repository name. For more information about how to create the correct record, see your DNS provider's documentation. For more information about the default domain for your site, see [What is GitHub Pages?](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).

   > \[!WARNING]
   > We strongly recommend that you do not use wildcard DNS records, such as `*.example.com`. These records put you at an immediate risk of domain takeovers, even if you verify the domain. For example, if you verify `example.com` this prevents someone from using `a.example.com` but they could still take over `b.a.example.com` (which is covered by the wildcard DNS record).

6. Open <span class="platform-mac">Terminal</span><span class="platform-linux">Terminal</span><span class="platform-windows">Git Bash</span>.

7. To confirm that your DNS record configured correctly, use the `dig` command, replacing *[WWW.EXAMPLE.COM](http://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM)* with your subdomain.

   ```shell
   $ dig WWW.EXAMPLE.COM +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
   > ;WWW.EXAMPLE.COM.                    IN      A
   > WWW.EXAMPLE.COM.             3592    IN      CNAME   YOUR-USERNAME.github.io.
   > YOUR-USERNAME.github.io.      43192   IN      CNAME   GITHUB-PAGES-SERVER .
   > GITHUB-PAGES-SERVER .         22      IN      A       192.0.2.1
   ```

8. If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the CNAME file to your local repository. For more information, see [Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages#cname-errors).

9. Optionally, to enforce HTTPS encryption for your site, select **Enforce HTTPS**. It can take up to 24 hours before this option is available. For more information, see [Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https).

   > \[!NOTE]
   > If you point your custom subdomain to your apex domain, you will encounter issues with enforcing HTTPS to your website, and you may encounter issues where your subdomain does not reach your GitHub Pages site at all.

## DNS records for your custom domain

If you are familiar with the process of configuring your domain for a GitHub Pages site, you can use the table below to find the DNS values for your specific scenario and the DNS record types that your DNS provider supports. For more information, including how to configure your GitHub Pages site on GitHub and how to verify the configuration using the `dig` command, refer to the sections above.

To configure an apex domain, add all of the `A` and `AAAA` records from the table below, or alternatively add only the `ALIAS`/`ANAME` record from the table. To configure an apex domain and `www` subdomain (for example, `example.com` and `www.example.com`), configure the apex domain and then the subdomain. For more information, see [Configuring an apex domain and the `www` subdomain variant](#configuring-an-apex-domain-and-the-www-subdomain-variant).

> \[!WARNING]
> We strongly recommend that you do not use wildcard DNS records, such as `*.example.com`. These records put you at an immediate risk of domain takeovers, even if you verify the domain. For example, if you verify `example.com` this prevents someone from using `a.example.com` but they could still take over `b.a.example.com` (which is covered by the wildcard DNS record).

## Securing your custom domain

If your GitHub Pages site is disabled but has a custom domain set up, it is at risk of a domain takeover. Having a custom domain configured with your DNS provider while your site is disabled could result in someone else hosting a site on one of your subdomains.

Verifying your custom domain prevents other GitHub users from using your domain with their repositories. If your domain is not verified, and your GitHub Pages site is disabled, you should immediately update or remove your DNS records with your DNS provider.
