    {

The key signature parameters that compose this presigned URL are:\n\n* `X-Amz-Algorithm`: Identifies the algorithm used to sign the URL.\n* `X-Amz-Credential`: Contains information about the credentials used to calculate the signature.\n* `X-Amz-Date`: The date and time (in ISO 8601 format) when the signature was created.\n* `X-Amz-Expires`: The duration in seconds that the presigned URL remains valid, starting from `X-Amz-Date`.\n* `X-Amz-Signature`: The signature proving the URL was signed using the secret key.\n* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders`: Lists the HTTP headers that were included in the signature calculation.\n\nNote\n\nThe signature parameters (e.g. `X-Amz-Algorithm`, `X-Amz-Credential`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Expires`, `X-Amz-Signature`) cannot be tampered with. Attempting to modify the resource, operation, or expiry will result in a `403/SignatureDoesNotMatch` error.\n\n## Supported operations\n\nR2 supports presigned URLs for the following HTTP methods:\n\n* `GET`: Fetch an object from a bucket\n* `HEAD`: Fetch an object's metadata from a bucket\n* `PUT`: Upload an object to a bucket\n* `DELETE`: Delete an object from a bucket\n\n`POST` (multipart form uploads via HTML forms) is not currently supported.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nTreat presigned URLs as bearer tokens. Anyone with the URL can perform the specified operation until it expires. Share presigned URLs only with intended recipients and consider using short expiration times for sensitive operations.\n\n## Custom domains\n\nPresigned URLs work with the S3 API domain (`<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`) and cannot be used with custom domains.\n\nIf you need authentication with R2 buckets accessed via custom domains (public buckets), use the [WAF HMAC validation feature](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#hmac-validation) (requires Pro plan or above).\n\n## Related resources\n\n[R2 API tokens ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/)Create credentials for generating presigned URLs.\n\n[Public buckets ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/)Alternative approach for public read access without authentication.\n\n[R2 bindings in Workers ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/)Alternative for server-side R2 access with built-in authentication.\n\n[Storing user generated content ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/storage/storing-user-generated-content/)Architecture guide for handling user uploads with R2.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Use R2 from Workers · Cloudflare R2 docs\ndescription: C3 (create-cloudflare-cli) is a command-line tool designed to help\n  you set up and deploy Workers & Pages applications to Cloudflare as fast as\n  possible.\nlastUpdated: 2025-09-30T16:36:58.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/index.md\n---\n\n## 1.

Bind your bucket to a Worker\n\nYou will need to bind your bucket to a Worker.\n\nBindings\n\nA binding is how your Worker interacts with external resources such as [KV Namespaces](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/), [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), or [R2 Buckets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/). A binding is a runtime variable that the Workers runtime provides to your code. You can declare a variable name in your Wrangler file that will be bound to these resources at runtime, and interact with them through this variable. Every binding's variable name and behavior is determined by you when deploying the Worker. Refer to the [Environment Variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) documentation for more information.\n\nA binding is defined in the Wrangler file of your Worker project's directory.\n\nTo bind your R2 bucket to your Worker, add the following to your Wrangler file. Update the `binding` property to a valid JavaScript variable identifier and `bucket_name` to the `<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>` you used to create your bucket in [step 2](#2-create-your-bucket):\n\n* wrangler.jsonc",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "* wrangler.toml",

    {
      "code": "For more detailed information on configuring your Worker (for example, if you are using [jurisdictions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions)), refer to the [Wrangler Configuration documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).\n\n## 4. Access your R2 bucket from your Worker\n\nWithin your Worker code, your bucket is now available under the `MY_BUCKET` variable and you can begin interacting with it.\n\nLocal Development mode in Wrangler\n\nBy default `wrangler dev` runs in local development mode. In this mode, all operations performed by your local worker will operate against local storage on your machine.\n\nIf you want the R2 operations that are performed during development to be performed against a real R2 bucket, you can set `\"remote\" : true` in the R2 binding configuration. Refer to [remote bindings documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings) for more information.\n\nAn R2 bucket is able to READ, LIST, WRITE, and DELETE objects. You can see an example of all operations below using the Module Worker syntax. Add the following snippet into your project's `index.js` file:\n\n* TypeScript",

    },
    {
      "code": "* JavaScript",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "Prevent potential errors when accessing request.body\n\nThe body of a [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) can only be accessed once. If you previously used `request.formData()` in the same request, you may encounter a TypeError when attempting to access `request.body`.\n\nTo avoid errors, create a clone of the Request object with `request.clone()` for each subsequent attempt to access a Request's body. Keep in mind that Workers have a [memory limit of 128 MB per Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#worker-limits) and loading particularly large files into a Worker's memory multiple times may reach this limit. To ensure memory usage does not reach this limit, consider using [Streams](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/streams/).\n\n## 5. Bucket access and privacy\n\nWith the above code added to your Worker, every incoming request has the ability to interact with your bucket. This means your bucket is publicly exposed and its contents can be accessed and modified by undesired actors.\n\nYou must now define authorization logic to determine who can perform what actions to your bucket. This logic lives within your Worker's code, as it is your application's job to determine user privileges. The following is a short list of resources related to access and authorization practices:\n\n1. [Basic Authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/basic-auth/): Shows how to restrict access using the HTTP Basic schema.\n2. [Using Custom Headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/auth-with-headers/): Allow or deny a request based on a known pre-shared key in a header.\n\nContinuing with your newly created bucket and Worker, you will need to protect all bucket operations.\n\nFor `PUT` and `DELETE` requests, you will make use of a new `AUTH_KEY_SECRET` environment variable, which you will define later as a Wrangler secret.\n\nFor `GET` requests, you will ensure that only a specific file can be requested. All of this custom logic occurs inside of an `authorizeRequest` function, with the `hasValidHeader` function handling the custom header logic. If all validation passes, then the operation is allowed.",
