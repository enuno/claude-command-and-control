Do not use gerund phrases.\n\nIf a 3rd-party integration guide is with a specific Cloudflare technology partner, add a Markdown component that indicates `<partner>` after the title.\n\n[**Context**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/context/): An introductory paragraph on the following steps and what they will accomplish.\n\nProvide context to the reader that is not in the section heading.\n\nEnd with a colon or a period. Use a colon if it immediately precedes the steps. Use a period if there is more material (such as a note) between the context and the procedure.\n\nDo not provide context for steps with a partial sentence that is completed by the numbered steps.\n\nMention any unique considerations between the 3rd-party and Cloudflare.\n\n[**Prerequisites**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/prerequisites/): Tasks or conditions that must be completed before a user can complete a series of steps.\n\nFor 3rd-party integration guides, include information about what you need to interact with the third party for the following steps.\n\n[**Steps**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/): Numbered steps that complete a task.\n\nLink out for basic concepts (Regex, JavaScript, web server maintenance).\n\nWarning\n\nStep-by-step instructions of 3rd-party environments are discouraged generally, but acceptable in certain situations. General preference is to link back to an article that someone else maintains.\n\nThey easily become out-of-date, especially if we can not access the 3rd-party product\n\n[**Links**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/links/): May be a bulleted list that references the 3rd-party product or in-text links to the 3rd-party process documentation.\n\nLink to reputable sources within reason.\n\n### Optional components\n\n[**Notes/warnings**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/notes-tips-warnings/)\n\n[**Examples**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/examples/)\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n**Tables**\n\n**Step validation**\n\nNote\n\nScreenshots of the 3rd-party product are highly discouraged. It has all the problems of video or screenshot maintenance, but with a much greater risk that something changes and we are not aware of it.\n\nIt may become a bigger problem if we can not access the 3rd-party product.\n\n## Templates\n\nSingle procedure 3rd-party integration guide",
