In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **API Tokens** page.\n\n   [Go to **Account API tokens**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens)\n\n2. Select **Create Token**.\n\n3. Under **Custom Token**, select **Get started**.\n\n4. Name your API Token in the **Token name** field.\n\n5. Under **Permissions**, select *Account*, *Cloudflare Pages* and *Edit*:\n\n6. Select **Continue to summary** > **Create Token**.\n\n![Follow the instructions above to create an API token for Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/select-api-token-for-pages.BUXEF2B7_1qpS7G.webp)\n\nNow that you have created your API token, you can use it to push your project from continuous integration platforms.\n\n### Get project account ID\n\nTo find your account ID, go to the **Zone Overview** page in the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\n[Go to **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/)\n\nFind your account ID in the **API** section on the right-hand side menu.\n\nIf you have not added a zone, add one by selecting **Add** > **Connect a domain**. You can purchase a domain from [Cloudflare's registrar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/).\n\n## Use GitHub Actions\n\n[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline when using GitHub. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository or deploy merged pull requests to production.\n\nAfter setting up your project, you can set up a GitHub Action to automate your subsequent deployments with Wrangler.\n\n### Add Cloudflare credentials to GitHub secrets\n\nIn the GitHub Action you have set up, environment variables are needed to push your project up to Cloudflare Pages. To add the values of these environment variables in your project's GitHub repository:\n\n1. Go to your project's repository in GitHub.\n2. Under your repository's name, select **Settings**.\n3. Select **Secrets** > **Actions** > **New repository secret**.\n4. Create one secret and put **CLOUDFLARE\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID** as the name with the value being your Cloudflare account ID.\n5. Create another secret and put **CLOUDFLARE\\_API\\_TOKEN** as the name with the value being your Cloudflare API token.\n\nAdd the value of your Cloudflare account ID and Cloudflare API token as `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, respectively. This will ensure that these secrets are secure, and each time your Action runs, it will access these secrets.\n\n### Set up a workflow\n\nCreate a `.github/workflows/pages-deployment.yaml` file at the root of your project. The `.github/workflows/pages-deployment.yaml` file will contain the jobs you specify on the request, that is: `on: [push]` in this case. It can also be on a pull request. For a detailed explanation of GitHub Actions syntax, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).\n\nIn your `pages-deployment.yaml` file, copy the following content:",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "In the above code block, you have set up an Action that runs when you push code to the repository. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` with your Cloudflare Pages project name and `YOUR_DIRECTORY_OF_STATIC_ASSETS` with your project's output directory, respectively.\n\nThe `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` will be automatically provided by GitHub Actions with the `contents: read` and `deployments: write` permission. This will enable our Cloudflare Pages action to create a Deployment on your behalf.\n\nNote\n\nThis workflow automatically triggers on the current git branch, unless you add a `branch` option to the `with` section.\n\n## Using CircleCI for CI/CD\n\n[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is another continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. It can be configured to efficiently run complex pipelines with caching, docker layer caching, and resource classes.\n\nSimilar to GitHub Actions, CircleCI can use Wrangler to continuously deploy your projects each time to push to your code.\n\n### Add Cloudflare credentials to CircleCI\n\nAfter you have generated your Cloudflare API token and found your account ID in the dashboard, you will need to add them to your CircleCI dashboard to use your environment variables in your project.\n\nTo add environment variables, in the CircleCI web application:\n\n1. Go to your Pages project > **Settings**.\n2. Select **Projects** in the side menu.\n3. Select the ellipsis (...) button in the project's row. You will see the option to add environment variables.\n4. Select **Environment Variables** > **Add Environment Variable**.\n5. Enter the name and value of the new environment variable, which is your Cloudflare credentials (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).\n\n![Follow the instructions above to add environment variables to your CircleCI settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/project-settings-env-var-v2.CMCUnm6I_9Jqdr.webp)\n\n### Set up a workflow\n\nCreate a `.circleci/config.yml` file at the root of your project. This file contains the jobs that will be executed based on the order of your workflow. In your `config.yml` file, copy the following content:",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "Your continuous integration workflow is broken down into jobs when using CircleCI. From the code block above, you can see that you first define a list of jobs that run on each commit. For example, your repository will run on a prebuilt docker image `cimg/node:18.7.0`. It first checks out the repository with the Node version specified in the image.\n\nNote\n\nWrangler requires a Node version of at least `16.17.0`. You must upgrade your Node.js version if your version is lower than `16.17.0`.\n\nYou can modify the Wrangler command with any [`wrangler pages deploy` options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy-1).\n\nAfter all the specified steps, define a `workflow` at the end of your file. You can learn more about creating a custom process with CircleCI from the [official documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/concepts/).\n\n## Travis CI for CI/CD\n\nTravis CI is an open-source continuous integration tool that handles specific tasks, such as pull requests and code pushes for your project workflow. Travis CI can be integrated into your GitHub projects, databases, and other preinstalled services enabled in your build configuration. To use Travis CI, you should have A GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab or Assembla account.\n\n### Add Cloudflare credentials to TravisCI\n\nIn your Travis project, add the Cloudflare credentials you have generated from the Cloudflare dashboard to access them in your `travis.yml` file. Go to your Travis CI dashboard and select your current project > **More options** > **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.\n\nSet the environment variable's name and value and the branch you want it to be attached to. You can also set the privacy of the value.\n\n### Setup\n\nGo to [Travis-ci.com](https://Travis-ci.com) and enable your repository by login in with your preferred provider. This guide uses GitHub. Next, create a `.travis.yml` file and copy the following into the file:",

A/B testing is a user experience research methodology applied when comparing two or more versions of a web page or application. With A/B testing, you can serve two or more versions of a webpage to users and divide traffic to your site.\n\n## Overview\n\nConfiguring different versions of your application for A/B testing will be unique to your specific use case. For all developers, A/B testing setup can be simplified into a few helpful principles.\n\nDepending on the number of application versions you have (this guide uses two), you can assign your users into experimental groups. The experimental groups in this guide are the base route `/` and the test route `/test`.\n\nTo ensure that a user remains in the group you have given, you will set and store a cookie in the browser and depending on the cookie value you have set, the corresponding route will be served.\n\n## Set up your Pages Function\n\nIn your project, you can handle the logic for A/B testing using [Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/). Pages Functions allows you to handle server logic from within your Pages project.\n\nTo begin:\n\n1. Go to your Pages project directory on your local machine.\n2. Create a `/functions` directory. Your application server logic will live in the `/functions` directory.\n\n## Add middleware logic\n\nPages Functions have utility functions that can reuse chunks of logic which are executed before and/or after route handlers. These are called [middleware](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/middleware/). Following this guide, middleware will allow you to intercept requests to your Pages project before they reach your site.\n\nIn your `/functions` directory, create a `_middleware.js` file.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you create your `_middleware.js` file at the base of your `/functions` folder, the middleware will run for all routes on your project. Learn more about [middleware routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/middleware/).\n\nFollowing the Functions naming convention, the `_middleware.js` file exports a single async `onRequest` function that accepts a `request`, `env` and `next` as an argument.",

Your default cookie version is given a value of `current`.\n\nIf the percentage of the number generated is lower than `50`, you will assign the cookie version to `new`. Based on the percentage randomly generated, you will set the cookie and serve the assets. After the conditional block, pass the request to `next()`. This will pass the request to Pages. This will result in 50% of users getting the `/test` homepage.\n\nThe `env.ASSETS.fetch()` function will allow you to send the user to a modified path which is defined through the `url` parameter. `env` is the object that contains your environment variables and bindings. `ASSETS` is a default Function binding that allows communication between your Function and Pages' asset serving resource. `fetch()` calls to the Pages asset-serving resource and returns the asset (`/test` homepage) to your website's visitor.\n\nBinding\n\nA Function is a Worker that executes on your Pages project to add dynamic functionality.

In the case where you have over 2000 static and/or 100 dynamic redirects rules, it is recommended to use [Bulk Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/create-dashboard/).\n\nYour header files can also be moved into a `_headers` folder in your publish directory. It is important to note that custom headers defined in the `_headers` file are not currently applied to responses from functions, even if the function route matches the URL pattern. To learn more about how to [handle headers, refer to Headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/).\n\nNote\n\nRedirects execute before headers. In the case of a request matching rules in both files, the redirect will take precedence.\n\n## Forms\n\nIn your form component, remove the `data-netlify = \"true\"` attribute or the Netlify attribute from the `<form>` tag. You can now put your form logic as a Pages Function and collect the entries to a database or an Airtable. Refer to the [handling form submissions with Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/tutorials/forms/) tutorial for more information.\n\n## Serverless functions\n\nNetlify functions and Pages Functions share the same filesystem convention using a `functions` directory in the base of your project to handle your serverless functions. However, the syntax and how the functions are deployed differs. Pages Functions run on Cloudflare Workers, which by default operate on the Cloudflare global network, and do not require any additional code or configuration for deployment.\n\nCloudflare Pages Functions also provides middleware that can handle any logic you need to run before and/or after your function route handler.\n\n### Functions syntax\n\nNetlify functions export an async event handler that accepts an event and a context as arguments. In the case of Pages Functions, you will have to export a single `onRequest` function that accepts a `context` object. The `context` object contains all the information for the request such as `request`, `env`, `params`, and returns a new Response.

To assign a custom domain to your Pages project, refer to [Custom Domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/).\n\n## Cleaning up your old application and assigning the domain\n\nIn the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Records** page.\n\n[Go to **Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records)\n\nReview that you have updated the CNAME record for your domain from Netlify to Cloudflare Pages. With your DNS record updated, requests will go to your Pages application.\n\nIn **DNS**, your record's **Content** should be your `<SUBDOMAIN>.pages.dev` subdomain.\n\nWith the above steps completed, you have successfully migrated your Netlify project to Cloudflare Pages.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Migrating from Vercel to Pages · Cloudflare Pages docs\ndescription: In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy your Vercel\n  application to Cloudflare Pages.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-09T15:47:46.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-from-vercel/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-from-vercel/index.md\n---\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy your Vercel application to Cloudflare Pages.\n\nYou should already have an existing project deployed on Vercel that you would like to host on Cloudflare Pages. Features such as Vercel's serverless functions are currently not supported in Cloudflare Pages.\n\n## Find your build command and build directory\n\nTo move your application to Cloudflare Pages, you will need to find your build command and build directory. Cloudflare Pages will use this information to build your application and deploy it.\n\nIn your Vercel Dashboard, find the project that you want to deploy. It should be configured to deploy from a GitHub repository.\n\n![Selecting a site in the Vercel Dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/vercel-deploy-1.D2ttJxis_ZDyq5R.webp)\n\nInside of your site dashboard, select **Settings**, then **General**.\n\n![Selecting Site Settings in site dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/vercel-deploy-2.Bz2cpjeg_ZWnFgf.webp)\n\nFind the **Build & Development settings** panel, which will have the **Build Command** and **Output Directory** fields. If you are using a framework, these values may not be filled in, but will show the defaults used by the framework. Save these for deploying to Cloudflare Pages. In the below image, the **Build Command** is `npm run build`, and the **Output Directory** is `build`.\n\n![Finding the Build Command and Output Directory fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/vercel-deploy-3.QXCg23KQ_ZSQ8Ij.webp)\n\n## Create a new Pages project\n\nAfter you have found your build directory and build command, you can move your project to Cloudflare Pages.\n\nThe [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) will instruct you how to add your GitHub project to Cloudflare Pages.\n\n## Add a custom domain\n\nNext, connect a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/) to your Pages project. This domain should be the same one as your currently deployed Vercel application.\n\n### Change domain nameservers\n\nIn most cases, you will want to [add your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).\n\nThis does involve changing your domain nameservers, but simplifies your Pages setup and allows you to use an apex domain for your project (like `example.com`).\n\nIf you want to take a different approach, read more about [custom domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/).\n\n### Set up custom domain\n\nTo add a custom domain:\n\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.\n\n   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)\n\n2. Select your Pages project > **Custom domains**.\n\n3. Select **Set up a domain**.\n\n4. Provide the domain that you would like to serve your Cloudflare Pages site on and select **Continue**.\n\n![Adding a custom domain for your Pages project through the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/domains.zq4iMU_J_jMmg9.webp)\n\nThe next steps vary based on if you [added your domain to Cloudflare](#change-domain-nameservers):\n\n* **Added to Cloudflare**: Cloudflare will set everything up for you automatically and your domain will move to an `Active` status.\n* **Not added to Cloudflare**: You need to [update some DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-subdomain) at your DNS provider to finish your setup.\n\n## Delete your Vercel app\n\nOnce your custom domain is set up and sending requests to Cloudflare Pages, you can safely delete your Vercel application.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCloudflare does not provide IP addresses for your Pages project because we do not require `A` or `AAAA` records to link your domain to your project. Instead, Cloudflare uses `CNAME` records.\n\nFor more details, refer to [Custom domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/).\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Migrating from Workers Sites to Pages · Cloudflare Pages docs\ndescription: Learn how to migrate from Workers Sites to Cloudflare Pages.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-09T15:47:46.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-from-workers/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-from-workers/index.md\n---\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to migrate an existing [Cloudflare Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/) application to Cloudflare Pages.\n\nAs a prerequisite, you should have a Cloudflare Workers Sites project, created with [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler).\n\nCloudflare Pages provides built-in defaults for every aspect of serving your site. You can port custom behavior in your Worker — such as custom caching logic — to your Cloudflare Pages project using [Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/). This enables an easy-to-use, file-based routing system. You can also migrate your custom headers and redirects to Pages.\n\nYou may already have a reasonably complex Worker and/or it would be tedious to splice it up into Pages' file-based routing system. For these cases, Pages offers developers the ability to define a `_worker.js` file in the output directory of your Pages project.\n\nNote\n\nWhen using a `_worker.js` file, the entire `/functions` directory is ignored - this includes its routing and middleware characteristics. Instead, the `_worker.js` file is deployed as is and must be written using the [Module Worker syntax](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/).\n\nBy migrating to Cloudflare Pages, you will be able to access features like [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) and automatic branch deploys with no extra configuration needed.\n\n## Remove unnecessary code\n\nWorkers Sites projects consist of the following pieces:\n\n1. An application built with a [static site tool](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/) or a static collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.\n2. If using a static site tool, a build directory (called `bucket` in the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/wrangler-configuration/)) where the static project builds your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.\n3. A Worker application for serving that build directory. For most projects, this is likely to be the `workers-site` directory.\n\nWhen moving to Cloudflare Pages, remove the Workers application and any associated Wrangler configuration files or build output. Instead, note and record your `build` command (if you have one), and the `bucket` field, or build directory, from the Wrangler file in your project's directory.\n\n## Migrate headers and redirects\n\nYou can migrate your redirects to Pages, by creating a `_redirects` file in your output directory. Pages currently offers limited support for advanced redirects. More support will be added in the future. For a list of support types, refer to the [Redirects documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/).\n\nNote\n\nA project is limited to 2,000 static redirects and 100 dynamic redirects, for a combined total of 2,100 redirects. Each redirect declaration has a 1,000-character limit. Malformed definitions are ignored. If there are multiple redirects for the same source path, the topmost redirect is applied.\n\nMake sure that static redirects are before dynamic redirects in your `_redirects` file.\n\nIn addition to a `_redirects` file, Cloudflare also offers [Bulk Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/#surpass-_redirects-limits), which handles redirects that surpasses the 2,100 redirect rules limit set by Pages.\n\nYour custom headers can also be moved into a `_headers` file in your output directory. It is important to note that custom headers defined in the `_headers` file are not currently applied to responses from Functions, even if the Function route matches the URL pattern. To learn more about handling headers, refer to [Headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/).\n\n## Create a new Pages project\n\n### Connect to your git provider\n\nAfter you have recorded your **build command** and **build directory** in a separate location, remove everything else from your application, and push the new version of your project up to your git provider. Follow the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) to add your project to Cloudflare Pages, using the **build command** and **build directory** that you saved earlier.\n\nIf you choose to use a custom domain for your Pages project, you can set it to the same custom domain as your currently deployed Workers application. Follow the steps for [adding a custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain) to your Pages project.\n\nNote\n\nBefore you deploy, you will need to delete your old Workers routes to start sending requests to Cloudflare Pages.\n\n### Using Direct Upload\n\nIf your Workers site has its custom build settings, you can bring your prebuilt assets to Pages with [Direct Upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/). In addition, you can serve your website's assets right to the Cloudflare global network by either using the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) or the drag and drop option.\n\nThese options allow you to create and name a new project from the CLI or dashboard. After your project deployment is complete, you can set the custom domain by following the [adding a custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain) steps to your Pages project.\n\n## Cleaning up your old application and assigning the domain\n\nAfter you have deployed your Pages application, to delete your Worker:\n\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.\n\n   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)\n\n2. Select your Worker.\n\n3. Go to **Manage** > **Delete Worker**.\n\nWith your Workers application removed, requests will go to your Pages application. You have successfully migrated your Workers Sites project to Cloudflare Pages by completing this guide.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Migrating a Jekyll-based site from GitHub Pages · Cloudflare Pages docs\ndescription: Learn how to migrate a Jekyll-based site from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-09T15:47:46.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\ntags: Ruby\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-jekyll-from-github-pages/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-jekyll-from-github-pages/index.md\n---\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to migrate an existing [GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) to Cloudflare Pages. Jekyll is one of the most popular static site generators used with GitHub Pages, and migrating your GitHub Pages site to Cloudflare Pages will take a few short steps.\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through:\n\n1. Adding the necessary dependencies used by GitHub Pages to your project configuration.\n2. Creating a new Cloudflare Pages site, connected to your existing GitHub repository.\n3. Building and deploying your site on Cloudflare Pages.\n4. (Optional) Migrating your custom domain.\n\nIncluding build times, this tutorial should take you less than 15 minutes to complete.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have a Jekyll-based site not deployed on GitHub Pages, refer to [the Jekyll framework guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-jekyll-site/).\n\n## Before you begin\n\nThis tutorial assumes:\n\n1. You have an existing GitHub Pages site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)\n2. You have some familiarity with running Ruby's command-line tools, and have both `gem` and `bundle` installed.\n3. You know how to use a few basic Git operations, including `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.\n4. You have read the [Get Started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) guide for Cloudflare Pages.\n\nIf you do not have Rubygems (`gem`) or Bundler (`bundle`) installed on your machine, refer to the installation guides for [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).\n\n## Preparing your GitHub Pages repository\n\nNote\n\nIf your GitHub Pages repository already has a `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` present, you can skip this step entirely. The GitHub Pages environment assumes a default set of Jekyll plugins that are not explicitly specified in a `Gemfile`.\n\nYour existing Jekyll-based repository must specify a `Gemfile` (Ruby's dependency configuration file) to allow Cloudflare Pages to fetch and install those dependencies during the [build step](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/build-configuration/).\n\nSpecifically, you will need to create a `Gemfile` and install the `github-pages` gem, which includes all of the dependencies that the GitHub Pages environment assumes.\n\n[Version 2 of the Pages build environment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/build-image/#languages-and-runtime) will use Ruby 3.2.2 for the default Jekyll build.
