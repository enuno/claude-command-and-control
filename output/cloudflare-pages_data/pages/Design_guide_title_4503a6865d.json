Does the product enable them to do something? Can the product do something?\n\n* **Question**\n\n  * Yes/no questions should start with structures like:\n\n    * Can I....\n    * (Can/Does) the product...\n\n* **Answer**\n\n  * Start the answer with Yes/No.\n\n    * ✅ Yes. Cloudflare Access supports several providers simultaneously.\n    * ❌ Cloudflare Access supports several providers simultaneously.\n\n  * Always follow with a short contextualization. Give the user all the information they need.\n\n### Procedural\n\nThis question type addresses doubts regarding how to achieve a goal with the product, or how the product works. They should normally be addressed by either tutorials or how-tos in the main documentation, but it is worth calling out some commonly asked procedural questions in the FAQ too, and linking back to other areas of the documentation.\n\n* **Question**\n\n  * Procedural questions should start with structures like:\n\n    * How do I....\n    * How does the product...\n    * How does ... work?\n\n* **Answer**\n\n  * Give concise but complete answers\n  * **Link out to relevant documentation** (tutorials, how-tos, even blog posts) for more in-depth information\n\n### Definitions\n\nWith this question type, users want to know what certain elements are. While this type of question should be addressed by the glossary, it is helpful to call out some basic definitions in the FAQ too (think of definitions for essential, recurring features in the product), and link out to the relevant part of the documentation.\n\n* **Question**\n  * Definition questions should start with this structure:\n    * What is/are...\n\n* **Answer**\n\n  * Think of a dictionary – short, concise, informational definitions help\n  * Link out to the glossary or other relevant documentation if needed\n\n### Scenarios\n\nWith this type of question, the user will know how to tie the product to a specific real-life scenario they have had happening, or think will happen. They want to know if the product is fit to help them in those cases, too. While **tutorials** should address this type of questions, it is worth calling out the most basic scenario-related questions in the FAQ too, so as to help the user decide whether the product is a good fit for their needs.\n\n* **Question**\n  * Scenario questions should start with this structure:\n    * What if...\n\n* **Answer**\n\n  * Give the relevant answer in the first sentence. Does the product work in that scenario?\n  * Add brief context in a couple more sentences. If the product works, how?\n  * Link out to relevant documentation\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThis is a peculiar question type, in that the user notices something unexpected with the product and starts by stating what it is; questions can be left implicit: \"what is wrong and how do I fix it?\"\n\n* **Error**\n\n  * I see...\n  * `<Product>` does not work as expected when...\n\n* **Answer**\n\n  * Provide a **reason** why the user is seeing what they are seeing.\n  * Provide short, lean, actionable steps to solve the error\n  * Link out to tutorials or how-tos for more information.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nIf the FAQ includes more than 5-10 questions, revisit the user workflow and determine if any of the content in the FAQ should live elsewhere in the doc set.\n\nUse sections if your product is large or incorporates several other products (like Cloudflare One). Try to limit the number of questions in each example and revisit the user workflow if the number of FAQs grows unwieldy.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Get started · Cloudflare Style Guide\ndescription: The purpose of Get started content is to help users go from not\n  using a product to successfully configuring and setting up.\nlastUpdated: 2025-06-24T21:05:23.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/content-types/get-started/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/content-types/get-started/index.md\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of Get started content is to help users go from not using a product to successfully configuring and setting up.\n\n## content\\_type",
