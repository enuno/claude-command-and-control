In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins** > **Add New**.\n\nSearch for `Simply Static` and confirm that the resulting plugin that you will be installing matches the plugin below.\n\n![Simply Static plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/simply-static.B1STKlmC_ZDt3bU.webp)\n\nSelect **Install** on the plugin. After it has finished installing, select **Activate**.\n\n### Export your WordPress site\n\nAfter you have installed the plugin, go to your WordPress dashboard > **Simply Static** > **GENERATE STATIC FILES**.\n\nIn the **Activity Log**, find the **ZIP archive created** message and select **Click here to download** to download your ZIP file.\n\n### Deploy your WordPress site with Pages\n\nWith your ZIP file downloaded, deploy your site to Pages:\n\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.\n\n   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)\n\n2. Select **Create application** > **Pages** > **Use direct upload**.\n\n3. Name your project, then select **Create project**.\n\n4. Drag and drop your ZIP file (or unzipped folder of assets) or select it from your computer.\n\n5. After your files have been uploaded, select **Deploy site**.\n\nYour WordPress site will now be live on Pages.\n\nEvery time you make a change to your WordPress site, you will need to download a new ZIP file from the WordPress dashboard and redeploy to Cloudflare Pages. Automatic updates are not available with the free version of Simply Static.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere are some features available in WordPress sites that will not be supported in a static site environment:\n\n* WordPress Forms.\n* WordPress Comments.\n* Any links to `/wp-admin` or similar internal WordPress routes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following this guide, you have successfully deployed a static version of your WordPress site to Cloudflare Pages.\n\nWith a static version of your site being served, you can:\n\n* Move your WordPress site to a custom domain or subdomain. Refer to [Custom domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/) to learn more.\n* Run your WordPress instance locally, or put your WordPress site behind [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/#customize-preview-deployments-access) to only give access to your contributors. This has a significant effect on the number of attack vectors for your WordPress site and its content.\n* Downgrade your WordPress hosting plan to a cheaper plan. Because the memory and bandwidth requirements for your WordPress instance are now smaller, you can often host it on a cheaper plan, or moving to shared hosting.\n\nConnect with the [Cloudflare Developer community on Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com) to ask questions and discuss the platform with other developers.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Enable Zaraz · Cloudflare Pages docs\ndescription: Cloudflare Zaraz gives you complete control over third-party tools\n  and services for your website, and allows you to offload them to Cloudflare's\n  edge, improving the speed and security of your website.

In practical terms, you can use Cloudflare Tunnel to allow remote access to services running on your local machine.

In this guide, you will install Cloudflare Tunnel, and create a new tunnel to provide access to a locally running application. You will need a Cloudflare account to begin using Cloudflare Tunnel.\n\n## Installing Cloudflare Tunnel\n\nCloudflare Tunnel can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. To learn about installing Cloudflare Tunnel, refer to the [Install cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/) page in the Cloudflare for Teams documentation.\n\nConfirm that `cloudflared` is installed correctly by running `cloudflared --version` in your command line:",

      "code": "## Run a local service\n\nThe easiest way to get up and running with Cloudflare Tunnel is to have an application running locally, such as a [React](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) or [SvelteKit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-kit-site/) site. When you are developing an application with these frameworks, they will often make use of a `npm run develop` script, or something similar, which mounts the application and runs it on a `localhost` port. For example, the popular `vite` tool runs your in-development React application on port `5173`, making it accessible at the `http://localhost:5173` address.\n\n## Start a Cloudflare Tunnel\n\nWith a local development server running, a new Cloudflare Tunnel can be instantiated by running `cloudflared tunnel` in a new command line window, passing in the `--url` flag with your `localhost` URL and port. `cloudflared` will output logs to your command line, including a banner with a tunnel URL:",

For example, you can provide `cloudflared` with a [configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/configuration-file/) to add more complex routing and tunnel setups that go beyond a simple `--url` flag. You can also [attach a Cloudflare DNS record](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/dns/) to a domain or subdomain for an easily accessible, long-lived tunnel to your local machine.\n\nFinally, by incorporating Cloudflare Access, you can provide [secure access to your tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/) without exposing your entire server, or compromising on security.

An existing website can be modified at any time, but new projects can be initialized with these settings, too. Either way, altering the project settings will not be reflected until its next deployment.\n\nWarning\n\nBe sure to trigger a new deployment after changing any settings.\n\n## Registry Access Token\n\nEvery package registry should have a means of issuing new access tokens. Ideally, you should create a new token specifically for Pages, as you would with any other CI/CD platform.\n\nWith npm, you can [create and view tokens through its website](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens) or you can use the `npm` CLI.
