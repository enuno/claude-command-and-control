Transport-based pricing does not apply to all models.\n\n* WebSocket: $0.0092 per audio minute output (836.36 neurons per audio minute output)\n* Regular HTTP: $0.0052 per audio minute output (472.73 neurons per audio minute output)\n\n\\* indicates a required field\n\n* `audio` object required\n\n* `body` object required\n\n* `contentType` string required\n\n* `custom_topic_mode` string\n\nSets how the model will interpret strings submitted to the custom\\_topic param. When strict, the model will only return topics submitted using the custom\\_topic param. When extended, the model will return its own detected topics in addition to those submitted using the custom\\_topic param.\n\n* `custom_topic` string\n\nCustom topics you want the model to detect within your input audio or text if present Submit up to 100\n\n* `custom_intent_mode` string\n\nSets how the model will interpret intents submitted to the custom\\_intent param. When strict, the model will only return intents submitted using the custom\\_intent param. When extended, the model will return its own detected intents in addition those submitted using the custom\\_intents param\n\n* `custom_intent` string\n\nCustom intents you want the model to detect within your input audio if present\n\n* `detect_entities` boolean\n\nIdentifies and extracts key entities from content in submitted audio\n\n* `detect_language` boolean\n\nIdentifies the dominant language spoken in submitted audio\n\nRecognize speaker changes. Each word in the transcript will be assigned a speaker number starting at 0\n\n* `dictation` boolean\n\nIdentify and extract key entities from content in submitted audio\n\nSpecify the expected encoding of your submitted audio\n\nArbitrary key-value pairs that are attached to the API response for usage in downstream processing\n\n* `filler_words` boolean\n\nFiller Words can help transcribe interruptions in your audio, like 'uh' and 'um'\n\nKey term prompting can boost or suppress specialized terminology and brands.\n\nKeywords can boost or suppress specialized terminology and brands.\n\nThe BCP-47 language tag that hints at the primary spoken language. Depending on the Model and API endpoint you choose only certain languages are available.\n\n* `measurements` boolean\n\nSpoken measurements will be converted to their corresponding abbreviations.\n\n* `mip_opt_out` boolean\n\nOpts out requests from the Deepgram Model Improvement Program.

When set to true, the endpoint sends continuous updates, meaning transcription results may evolve over time. Note: Supported only for webosockets.\n\n* `endpointing` string\n\nIndicates how long model will wait to detect whether a speaker has finished speaking or pauses for a significant period of time. When set to a value, the streaming endpoint immediately finalizes the transcription for the processed time range and returns the transcript with a speech\\_final parameter set to true. Can also be set to false to disable endpointing\n\n* `vad_events` boolean\n\nIndicates that speech has started. You'll begin receiving Speech Started messages upon speech starting. Note: Supported only for webosockets.\n\n* `utterance_end_ms` boolean\n\nIndicates how long model will wait to send an UtteranceEnd message after a word has been transcribed.
