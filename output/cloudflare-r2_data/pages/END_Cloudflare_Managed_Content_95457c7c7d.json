Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.\n  2. Go to **Security** > **Bots**.\n  3. Select **Configure Bot Fight Mode**.\n  4. Turn **Instruct bot traffic with robots.txt** on.\n\n* New dashboard\n\n  1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.\n\n     [Go to **Settings**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)\n\n  2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.\n\n  3. Go to **robots.txt setting**.\n\n  4. Turn **robots.txt setting** on.\n\n## Content Signals Policy\n\nFree zones that do not have their own `robots.txt` file and do not use the managed `robots.txt` feature will display the Content Signals Policy when a crawler requests the `robots.txt` file for your zone.\n\nThis file only outlines the Content Signals framework. It does not express your preferences or rights associated with your content.",
