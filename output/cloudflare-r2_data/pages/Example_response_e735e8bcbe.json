You are at risk of a subdomain takeover. |\n| [Dangling `AAAA` Records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#a-and-aaaa) | A record is pointing to an IPv6 address that you might no longer control. You are at risk of a subdomain takeover. |\n| [Dangling `CNAME` Records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#a-and-aaaa) | A record is pointing to a resource that cannot be found. You are at risk of a subdomain takeover. |\n| [DMARC Record Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#dmarc) | We detect an incorrect or missing `DMARC` record. |\n| [Domains missing TLS Encryption](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/get-started/) | We detect that there is no TLS encryption for this domain. |\n| [Domains supporting older TLS version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/protocols/) | This domain supports older versions of the TLS protocol. |\n| [Domains without 'Always Use HTTPS'](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https/) | HTTP requests to this domain may not redirect to its HTTPS equivalent. |\n| [Domains without HSTS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/http-strict-transport-security/) | HTTP Strict Transport Security (`HSTS`), is a header which allows a website to specify and enforce security policy in client web browsers. This policy enforcement protects secure websites from downgrade attacks SSL stripping and cookie hijacking. |\n| [Exposed RDP Servers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/rdp/) | We detect an RDP server that is exposed to the public Internet. |\n| [Get notified of malicious client-side scripts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/alerts/) | We detect that Page Shield alerts are not configured. You will not receive notifications when we detect potential malicious scripts executing in your client-side environment. |\n| [Increased body response size detected on API endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/) | Investigate changes, abuse, or successful attacks that may have led to this increase in response body size. |\n| [Increased errors detected on API endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/) | Investigate changes, abuse, or successful attacks that may have led to this increase in errors. |\n| [Increased latency detected on API endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/) | Investigate changes, abuse, or successful attacks that may have led to this increase in response latency. |\n| [Managed Rules not deployed](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) | No managed rules deployed on a WAF protected domain. |\n| [Upgrade to new Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/upgrade/) | Upgrade to new Managed Rules system required for optimal protection. |\n| [Mixed-authentication API endpoints detected](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/#managed-labels) | Not all of the successful requests against API endpoints carried session identifiers. |\n| [New API endpoints detected](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/api-discovery/) | API Discovery detects new API endpoints in your zone's traffic. |\n| [New CASB integrations found](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/) | New CASB integrations have been found. |\n| [Overprovisioned Access Policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) | We detect an Access policy to allow everyone access to your application. |\n| [Page Shield not enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/get-started/) | Page Shield helps meet PCI DSS v4.0 compliance regarding requirement 6.4.3. |\n| [SPF Record Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#spf) | We detect an incorrect or missing `SPF` record. |\n| [Schema Validation missing from eligible API endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/) | Apply the learned schema to protect your API against fuzzing attacks. |\n| [Sensitive data in API response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/#sensitive-data-detection) | Sensitive data in API responses detected. |\n| [Turn on JavaScript Detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/javascript-detections/) | One or more of your Bot Management enabled zones does not have JavaScript Detection enabled, which is a critical part of our bot detection suite. |\n| [Unassigned Access seats](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) | We detect a Zero Trust subscription that is not configured yet. |\n| [Unauthenticated API endpoints detected](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/#managed-labels) | None of the successful requests against API endpoints carried session identifiers. |\n| [Unprotected Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/#4-connect-your-origin-to-cloudflare) | We detect an application that is served by a Cloudflare Tunnel but not protected by a corresponding Access policy. |\n| [Unproxied `A` Records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#a-and-aaaa) | This DNS record is not proxied by Cloudflare. Cloudflare can not protect this origin because it is exposed to the public Internet. |\n| [Unproxied `AAAA` Records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#a-and-aaaa) | This DNS record is not proxied by Cloudflare. Cloudflare can not protect this origin because it is exposed to the public Internet. |\n| [Unproxied `CNAME` Records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/#dns-only-records) | This DNS record is not proxied by Cloudflare. Cloudflare can not protect this origin because it is exposed to the public Internet. |\n| [Users without MFA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/) | We detect that a Cloudflare administrative user has not enabled multifactor authentication. |\n| [Zones without WAF Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/) | We detect that this domain does not have the WAF's Managed Rules enabled. You are at risk from zero-day and other common vulnerabilities. |\n| [No Turnstile enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) | We detect that there is no Turnstile widget configured on the account. |\n\nFor more information on available operations for Security Insights, refer to [Review Security Insights](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/security-insights/review-insights/).\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: 404 - Page Not Found · Cloudflare Spectrum docs\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/404/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/404/index.md\n---",
