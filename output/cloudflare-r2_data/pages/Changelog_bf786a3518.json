Cloudflare has moved existing firewall rules to [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/). For more information on this change, refer to the [upgrade guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/firewall-rules-upgrade/).\n\nIn a firewall rule you define an [expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that tells Cloudflare what to look for in a request, and specify the appropriate [action](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/actions/) to take when those conditions are met. Expressions can reference [IP lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#ip-lists) - groups of IP addresses that you can reference collectively by name.\n\nTo write firewall rule expressions, use the [Rules language](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/), a powerful expression language inspired in the Wireshark Display Filter language.\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Troubleshooting · Cloudflare Firewall Rules (deprecated) docs\ndescription: The following topics are useful for troubleshooting firewall issues.\nlastUpdated: 2024-12-12T14:55:48.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/troubleshooting/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/troubleshooting/index.md\n---\n\nThe following topics are useful for troubleshooting firewall issues.\n\n* [Required firewall rule changes to enable URL normalization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/troubleshooting/required-changes-to-enable-url-normalization/)\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: 404 - Page Not Found · Google tag gateway for advertisers docs\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/google-tag-gateway/404/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/google-tag-gateway/404/index.md\n---",
