For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n\"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n(d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\nYou may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\nTo apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n  wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nc. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\nd. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\ne. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\nf. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\ng. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\nh. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\ni. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\nj. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nk. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\na. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\nb. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n5. Downstream recipients.\n\na. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\nb. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\na. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\ni. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\nii. a copyright notice;\n\niii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\niv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\nv. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\nb. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\nc. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nb. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\nRelease         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible? (1)\n\n0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\n(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\nB.

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\ni. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\nii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\niv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\nv. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\nvi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\na. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\nb. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\nc. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\nd. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\nplaintext\nCopyright (c) 2009-2011, Mozilla Foundation and contributors\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the names of the Mozilla Foundation nor the names of project\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\n  software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

They generate prompts, moderate content, and\n  produce images for various applications.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-13T13:40:40.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\ntags: AI\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-asset-creation/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-asset-creation/index.md\n---\n\nCombining text-generation models with text-to-image models can lead to powerful AI systems capable of generating visual content based on input prompts. This integration can be achieved through a collaborative framework where a text-generation model generates prompts for the text-to-image model based on input text.\n\nHere's how the process can work:\n\n* Input Text Processing: The input text is provided to the system, which can be anything from a simple sentence to multiple paragraphs. This text serves as the basis for generating visual content.\n\n* Prompt Generation: The text-generation model generates prompts based on the input text. These prompts are specifically crafted to guide the text-to-image model in generating images that are contextually relevant to the input text. The prompts can include descriptions, keywords, or other cues to guide the image generation process.\n\n* Content Moderation: Text-classification models can be employed to ensure that the generated assets comply with content policies\n\n* Text-to-Image Model: A text-to-image model takes the prompts generated by the text-generation model as input and produces corresponding images. The text-to-image model learns to translate textual descriptions into visual representations, aiming to capture the essence and context conveyed by the input text.\n\nExample uses of such compositions of AI models can be employed to generation visual assets for marketing, publishing, presentations, and more.\n\n![Figure 1 asset generation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/ai-asset-generation.BN6tfVXY_2g5MiU.svg)\n\n1. **Client upload**: Send POST request with content to API endpoint.\n2. **Prompt generation**: Generate prompt for later-stage text-to-image model by calling [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) [text generation models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) with content as input.\n3. **Safety check**: Check for compliance with safety guidelines by calling [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) [text classification models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) with the previously generated prompt as input.\n4. **Image generation**: Generate image by calling [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) [text-to-image models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) previously generated prompt.\n\n* [Community project: content-based asset creation demo](https://auto-asset.pages.dev/)\n* [Workers AI: Text generation models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/)\n* [Workers AI: Text-to-image models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/)\n* [Workers AI: llamaguard-7b-awq](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llamaguard-7b-awq/)\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Composable AI architecture · Cloudflare Reference Architecture docs\ndescription: The architecture diagram illustrates how AI applications can be\n  built end-to-end on Cloudflare, or single services can be integrated with\n  external infrastructure and services.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-13T13:40:40.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\ntags: AI\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/index.md\n---\n\nThe AI market is witnessing a rapid evolution, propelled by the swift pace of technological advancement. With breakthroughs occurring frequently, staying up-to-date with the latest innovations is imperative for organizations aiming to remain competitive. Short iteration cycles and agility have become indispensable in this landscape, allowing businesses to swiftly adopt and leverage the newest advancements in AI technology.\n\nIn this dynamic environment, the concept of composability, data portability, and standard APIs emerges as crucial factors in navigating the complexities of the AI ecosystem:\n\n* Composability refers to the ability to assemble various AI components into tailored solutions, enabling organizations to mix and match different technologies to suit their specific needs.\n* Data portability plays a pivotal role in facilitating seamless data exchange between different AI systems and platforms, ensuring interoperability and preventing data silos.\n* Standard APIs for interoperability serve as the linchpin for integrating diverse AI components, enabling seamless communication and collaboration between disparate systems.\n\nThe significance of composability, data portability, and standard APIs becomes particularly pronounced in mitigating vendor lock-in and fostering flexibility. By embracing these principles, organizations can sidestep dependency on single vendors and instead opt for a best-in-class approach, selecting the most suitable solutions for their unique requirements. Overall, these principles pave the way for a more agile, adaptable, and future-proof AI ecosystem.\n\nCloudflare's AI platform has been designed with these principles in mind. The architecture diagram illustrates how AI applications can be built end-to-end on Cloudflare, or single services can be integrated with external infrastructure and services.\n\n## Composable AI infrastructure\n\n![Figure 1: Composable AI architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/ai-composable.CBIbt7we_ZPF858.svg)\n\n1. **Compute**: The compute layer is the core of the application. All business logic, as well as use of other components, is defined here. The compute layer interacts with other services such as inference services, vector search, databases and data storage. Serverless solutions such as [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) offer fast iteration and automatic scaling, which allows developers to focus on the use case instead of infrastructure management. Importantly for composability is the support of standard interfaces such as HTTP or TCP, which the Workers' runtime both supports via the [`fetch()` API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) and [`connect()` API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) respectively.\n2. **Inference**: AI inference is responsible for the AI-capabilities of the application. Operational models vary between self-hosting models or consuming Inference-as-a-service providers such as [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/). In the latter case, [REST APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai/methods/run/) make interacting with inference services from any service/client easy to implement. Using platform-specific integrations such as [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/) for interaction between Workers and other services enable simplified development as complexity such as authentication is abstracted away.\n3. **Vector Search**: Certain use cases such as [RAG](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/) leverage vector search for similarity matching. Operational models vary between self-hosting databases or consuming vector-specific database-as-a-service (DBaaS) providers such as [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/). In the latter case, [REST APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/vectorize/subresources/indexes/methods/list/) make interacting with it from any service/client easy to implement. Using platform-specific integrations such as [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/get-started/embeddings/#3-bind-your-worker-to-your-index) for interaction between Workers and other services enable simplified development as complexity such as authentication is abstracted away.\n4. **Data & Storage**: Databases and data storage add state to AI applications. User management, session storage and persisting data are common requirements for AI applications. Depending on the use case, different solutions are required such as relationship databases or object storage. A variety of solutions for self-hosted or managed services exist. On Cloudflare, this could be for instance [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) and [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/). REST APIs make interacting with inference services from any service/client easy to implement. Using platform-specific integrations such as Bindings for interaction between Workers and data and database services enable simplified development as complexity such as authentication is abstracted away.\n\n* [Workers: Serverless compute](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)\n* [Workers AI: Serverless AI inference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)\n* [Vectorize: Serverless Vector database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)\n* [D1: Serverless SQLite database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)\n* [R2: Object storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Multi-vendor AI observability and control · Cloudflare Reference\n  Architecture docs\ndescription: By shifting features such as rate limiting, caching, and error\n  handling to the proxy layer, organizations can apply unified configurations\n  across services and inference service providers.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-13T13:40:40.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\ntags: AI\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/index.md\n---\n\nThe AI landscape is rapidly evolving with new models, services, and applications emerging daily. Many developers and organizations seek to enhance agility by opting for inference-as-a-service solutions like [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), rather than developing or managing models themselves.\n\nInference-as-a-Service is a cloud-based model that allows users to deploy and execute AI without managing underlying infrastructure. The platform handles all aspects of model serving, including scaling resources based on demand, often-times supporting both real-time and batch inference. Users can send input data to the model via API calls, with the service provider managing servers, scaling, and maintenance tasks. Typically operating on a pay-as-you-go model, inference services simplify model deployment and scaling, enabling organizations to leverage AI capabilities without infrastructure complexities.\n\nAs this field evolves rapidly, developers and organizations face several challenges:\n\n* Fragmentation: Many inference service providers offer only a limited range of models and features. Different use cases may require multiple vendors, leading to fragmentation.\n* Availability: With increasing demand and fast-paced technological advancements, inference service providers struggle to maintain high API availability.\n* Lack of observability: Providers often offer limited analytics and logging capabilities, which vary across vendors. Gaining a unified view of AI usage proves challenging.\n* Lack of security control: Organizations encounter difficulties in maintaining adequate security measures.\n* Lack of cost control: Understanding usage insights can be challenging, and the absence of custom rate limits poses risks in public-facing AI use cases.\n\nUsing a forward proxy can mitigate these challenges. Positioned between the service making inference requests and the inference service platform, it serves as a single point for observability and control. By shifting features such as rate limiting, caching, and error handling to the proxy layer, organizations can apply unified configurations across services and inference service providers.\n\n## AI forward proxy setup\n\nThe following architecture illustrates the setup of [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) as a forward proxy between a service and one or multiple AI inference providers, such as [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)\n\n![Figure 1: Multi-vendor AI architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/ai-multi-vendor-observability-control.DprqSV76_1ghbSJ.svg)\n\n1. **Inference request**: Send POST request to your AI gateway.\n2. **Request proxying**: Forward `POST` request to AI Inference provider or serve response from [cache, if enabled and available](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching). During this process, both [analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/analytics/) and [logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/) are collected. Additionally, controls such as Rate Limiting are enforced.\n3. **Error handling**: In case of errors, retry request or fallback to other inference provider, depending on configuration.\n\n* [AI Gateway: Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/)\n* [AI Gateway: Supported Providers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/)\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) · Cloudflare Reference Architecture docs\ndescription: RAG combines retrieval with generative models for better text.

This integration enables RAG to overcome the limitations of traditional generative models by ensuring that the generated text is grounded in factual information and context. RAG aims to solve the problem of information overload by efficiently retrieving and incorporating only the most relevant information into the generated text, leading to improved coherence and accuracy. Overall, RAG represents a significant advancement in NLP, offering a more robust and contextually aware approach to text generation.\n\nExamples for application of these technique includes for instance customer service chat bots that use a knowledge base to answer support requests.\n\nIn the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), knowledge seeding involves incorporating external information from pre-existing sources into the generative process, while querying refers to the mechanism of retrieving relevant knowledge from these sources to inform the generation of coherent and contextually accurate text.

These platforms allow anyone to build applications by handling everything from code generation, testing and debugging, to project deployment.\n\nBuilding the infrastructure for such a platform introduces a unique set of challenges. AI-generated code is inherently untrusted and must be executed in a secure, sandbox to prevent abuse and ensure isolation between users. To support rapid, conversational development, the platform must provide near-instantaneous feedback loops with live previews and real-time debugging. Finally, the platform needs a way to deploy and host the thousands or millions of applications its users will create, without running up the costs of traditional server infrastructure.\n\nCloudflare has all the components required to build one of these platforms — from middleware that connects to AI models, to secure sandboxes for code execution, and a serverless deployment platform that scales to millions of applications.\n\n![Figure 1: AI Vibe Coding Platform on Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/cf-vibe-plat.DnKeZsm__oDpPW.svg)\n\nTo get started with a reference implementation of an AI vibe coding platform immediately, deploy this [starter template](https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk) to your Cloudflare account:\n\n[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk)\n\n## Core Architecture Components\n\n![Figure 2: Vibe Hosting Overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/vibe-hosting-overview.DYE1tifD_1wxTAg.svg)\n\nTo build an AI-powered coding platform, you will need these key components:\n\n* **AI for Code Generation:** Integrate with AI models to interpret user prompts and automatically generate code.\n* **Secure Execution Sandbox:** Provide a secure, isolated environment where users can instantly run and test untrusted, AI-generated code.\n* **Scalable Application Deployment :** Deploy and host AI-generated applications at scale.\n* **Analytics & Observability:** Collect logs and metrics to monitor AI usage, application performance, and platform costs.\n\n## AI Integration and Code generation\n\n#### Connecting to AI Providers for Code Generation\n\nThe first step is processing a user's natural language prompt and securely routing it to an AI model to generate code.\n\nWhen using various AI providers, you need visibility into costs, the ability to cache responses to reduce expenses, and failover capabilities to ensure reliability. [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) acts as a unified control point between your platform and AI providers to deliver these capabilities, enabling:\n\n* A [unified access point](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/) to route requests across LLM providers, allowing you to use [models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) from a range of providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others)\n* [Caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/) for popular responses, so when someone asks to \"build a todo list app\", the gateway can serve a cached response instead of going to the provider (saving inference costs)\n* [Observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/analytics/) into the requests, tokens used, and response times across all providers in one place\n* [Cost tracking](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/costs/) across AI providers\n\n#### Making your AI better at building on Cloudflare\n\nIf you’re building an AI code generator and want it to be more knowledgeable about how to best build applications on Cloudflare, there are two tools we recommend using:\n\n* **[Cloudflare Workers Prompt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/prompting/#build-workers-using-a-prompt):** Structured prompt with examples that teach AI models about Cloudflare's APIs, configuration patterns, and best practices. Include these in your AI system for higher quality code output.\n* **[Cloudflare’s Documentation MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main/apps/docs-vectorize):** If your AI tool supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/), connect it to Cloudflare's documentation MCP server to get up-to-date knowledge about Cloudflare’s platform.\n\n## Development environment for executing AI-generated code\n\nBoth [Sandboxes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-06-24-announcing-sandboxes/) and [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/) provide secure, isolated environments for executing untrusted AI-generated code. They offer:\n\n* **Strong isolation and sandboxing controls** to prevent malicious or buggy code from affecting other instances\n* **Fast startup times** to enable rapid iteration cycles with real-time feedback\n* **Real-time output streaming** of logs and results for live progress updates and debugging\n* **Preview URLs** to allow users to test applications during development\n* **Global edge deployment** on Cloudflare's network for low-latency execution worldwide\n\n**Sandboxes provide a fully-managed solution** that works out-of-the-box, with [pre-built APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-08-05-sandbox-sdk-major-update/) for code execution, output formatting, and developer tools, making them ideal for most AI code execution use cases.\n\n![Figure 3: Vibe Code Development - Sandbox SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/ai-platform-sandbox.qMdiEB-p_ZPIJ4C.svg)\n\n**Containers offer complete runtime control** through custom Docker images, allowing you to run any language or framework with up to 4GB RAM and dedicated vCPU and are best when you need custom runtimes or resource-intensive workloads.\n\n![Figure 4: Isolated Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/BYO-sandbox.CQA4MeVc_Z1ndkr3.svg)\n\n## Deploying applications to production\n\nWhen building an AI-powered coding platform, you need to be able to deploy and host the thousands to millions of applications that the platform will generate.\n\n[Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) provides this infrastructure by enabling you to deploy unlimited applications, with each application running in its own isolated Worker instance, preventing one application from impacting others.\n\n**With Workers for Platforms, you get:**\n\n* **Isolation and multitenancy** — every application runs in its own dedicated Worker, a secure and isolated sandbox environment\n* **Egress control and usage limits** — Configure firewall policies for all outgoing requests through an [outbound worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/outbound-workers/) and [custom usage limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/custom-limits/) to prevent abuse\n* **Dedicated resources per project:** Attach a KV store or database to each application, enabling more powerful functionality while ensuring [resources](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/bindings/) are only accessible by the application they’re attached to.\n* **Logging & Observability** across the platform to gather insights, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues across applications\n\n![Figure 5: Complete Vibe Coding Platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/vibe-hosting-analytics.DQnWIR4i_105Egk.svg)\n\nCloudflare provides a complete set of services needed for building AI-powered platforms that need to run, test, and deploy untrusted code at scale.\n\nCloudflare has a template AI vibe coding platform that you can deploy, so you can get started with a complete example that handles everything from code generation, sandboxes development with a preview environment, and integration with Workers for Platforms for deploying and hosting the applications at scale.\n\n[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk)\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Automatic captioning for video uploads · Cloudflare Reference Architecture docs\ndescription: By integrating automatic speech recognition technology into video\n  platforms, content creators, publishers, and distributors can reach a broader\n  audience, including individuals with hearing impairments or those who prefer\n  to consume content in different languages.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-13T13:40:40.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\ntags: AI\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-video-caption/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-video-caption/index.md\n---\n\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have revolutionized the accessibility of video content by enabling the generation of subtitles and translations. These models utilize advanced algorithms to transcribe spoken words into text with high accuracy. By integrating ASR technology into video platforms, content creators, publishers, and distributors can reach a broader audience, including individuals with hearing impairments or those who prefer to consume content in different languages.\n\nThe process begins with capturing the audio from the video source, which is then fed into the ASR model. This model analyzes the audio waveform and converts it into a textual representation, capturing the spoken content in the form of subtitles. Furthermore, you can also use ASR models for language translation, enabling the creation of multilingual subtitles. Once the subtitles are generated, they can be displayed alongside the video, providing a synchronized text representation of the spoken content.\n\n## Automatic captioning on upload\n\n![Figure 1: Automatic captioning on upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/ai-auto-caption-architecture-diagram.CyBpgQKS_2g5MiU.svg)\n\n1. **Client upload**: Send POST request with both video and audio to API endpoint.\n2. **Audio transcription**: Generate timestamped transcriptions by calling [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) [automatic speech recognition (ARS) model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) with audio as input.

This will allow you to enhance data with AI-generated responses, such as detecting the sentiment score of some text or generating tags for an article. This document describes a simple way to get started if you are looking to give Workers AI a try and see how the [new and different AI models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) would perform with your data hosted in BigQuery.\n\n## User-based approach\n\nThis version of the integration is aimed at workflows that require interaction with users to fetch data or generate ad-hoc reports.\n\n![Figure 1: Ingesting Google BigQuery Data into Workers AI (user-based)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/user-based-architecture.C4nsq5nK_1PlWCM.svg)\n\n1. A user makes a request to a [Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) endpoint. (Which can optionally incorporate [Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) in front of it to authenticate users).\n2. Worker fetches [securely stored](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) Google Cloud Platform service account information such as service key and generates a JSON Web Token to issue an authenticated API request to BigQuery.\n3. Worker receives the data from BigQuery and [transforms it into a format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/using-bigquery-with-workers-ai/#6-format-results-from-the-query) that will make it easier to iterate when interacting with Workers AI.\n4. Using its [native integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/) with Workers AI, the Worker forwards the data from BigQuery which is then run against one of Cloudflare's hosted AI models.\n5. The original data retrieved from BigQuery alongside the AI-generated information is returned to the user as a response to the request initiated in step 1.\n\n## Cron-triggered approach\n\nFor periodic or longer workflows, you may opt for a batch approach. This diagram also explores more products where you can use the data ingested from BigQuery. It relies on [Cron Triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/), which are built into the Developer Platform and available for free when using Workers to schedule initialization of workloads.\n\n![Figure 2: Ingesting Google BigQuery Data into Workers AI (cron-triggered)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/scheduled-based-architecture.DkGnVQUK_Z1SJaaY.svg)\n\n1. [A Cron Trigger](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/) invokes the Worker without any user interaction.\n\n2. Worker fetches [securely stored](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) Google Cloud Platform service account information such as service key and generates a JSON Web Token to issue an authenticated API request to BigQuery.\n\n3. Worker receives the data from BigQuery and [transforms it into a format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/using-bigquery-with-workers-ai/#6-format-results-from-the-query) that will make it easier to iterate when interacting with Workers AI.\n\n4. Using its [native integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/) with Workers AI, the Worker forwards the data from BigQuery to generate some content related to it.\n\n5. Optionally, you can store the BigQuery data and the AI-generated data in a variety of different Cloudflare services.\n\n* Into [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), a SQL database.\n   * If in step four you used Workers AI to generate embeddings, you can store them in [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/). To learn more about this type of solution, please consider reviewing the reference architecture diagram on [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/).\n   * To [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) if the output of your data will be stored and consumed in a key/value fashion.\n   * If you prefer to save the data fetched from BigQuery and Workers AI into objects (such as images, files, JSONs), you can use [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), our egress-free object storage to do so.\n\n6. You can set up an integration so a system or a user gets notified whenever a new result is available or if an error occurs. It's also worth mentioning that Workers by themselves can already provide additional [observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/).\n\n* Sending an email with all the data retrieved and generated in the previous step is possible using [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/send-email-workers/).\n   * Since Workers allows you to issue HTTP requests, you can notify a webhook or API endpoint once the process finishes or if there's an error.\n\n* [Tutorial: Using BigQuery with Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/using-bigquery-with-workers-ai/)\n* [Workers AI: Get Started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/)\n* [Workers: Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/)\n* [Workers: Cron Triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/scheduled/)\n* [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/send-email-workers/)\n* [Create a GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#iam-service-accounts-create-console)\n* [Create a GCP service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console)\n* [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Reference Architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)\n* [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)\n* [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/)\n* [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)\n* [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Bot management · Cloudflare Reference Architecture docs\ndescription: Cloudflare has bot management capabilities to help identify and\n  mitigate automated traffic to protect domains from bad bots.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-13T13:40:40.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/bots/bot-management/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/bots/bot-management/index.md\n---\n\nCloudflare has bot management capabilities to help identify and mitigate automated traffic to protect domains from bad bots. [Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/) and [Super Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/super-bot-fight-mode/) are options available on Free and Pro/Business accounts respectively. They offer a subset of features and capabilities available for Enterprise accounts. This reference architecture diagram focuses on [Enterprise Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-management/) available for Enterprise customers.\n\nWith [Enterprise Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-management/) customers have the maximum protection, features, and capability. A [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) is exposed for every request. Cloudflare applies a layered detection approach to Bot Management with several detection engines that cumulatively can impact the bot score. A bot score is a score from 1 to 99 that indicates the likelihood that the request came from a bot. Scores below 30 are commonly associated with bot traffic and customers can then take action on this score with [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) or [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties). Additionally, customers can view this score along with other bot specifics like bot score source, bot detection IDs, and bot detection tags in the Bots, Security Analytics, and Events dashboards; these fields can also be seen in more detailed logs in Log Explorer or, with Log Push, logs with these respective fields can be exported to 3rd party SIEMs/Analytics platforms.\n\n* **Bot Score:** A [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-tags/) is a score from 1 to 99 that indicates how likely that request came from a bot. A score of 1 means Cloudflare is certain the request was automated.\n* **Bot Score Source:** Bot Score Source is the detection engine used for the bot score.\n* **Bot Detection ID:** [Detection IDs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/detection-ids/) are static rules used to detect predictable bot behavior with no overlap with human traffic. Detection IDs refer to the precise [detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-detection-engines/) used to identify a bot, which could be from heuristics, verified bot detections, or anomaly detections.\n* **Bot Tag:** [Bot tags](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-tags/) provide more detail about why Cloudflare assigned a [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) to a request.\n* **Verified Bots:** Cloudflare maintains [a list of \"Verified\" good bots](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots) which can be used in policies to insure good bots such as those associated with a search engine are not blocked.\n* **AI Bots:** [If the feature is enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots), Cloudflare will detect and block verified AI bots that respect `robots.txt` and crawl rate, and do not hide their behavior from your website. The rule has also been expanded to include more signatures of AI bots that do not follow the rules.\n\n## Cloudflare Bot Management Detection Engines\n\n* **Heuristics:** Cloudflare conducts a number of heuristic checks to identify automated traffic, and requests are matched against a growing database of malicious fingerprints. The [Heuristics engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/#heuristics) immediately gives automated requests a score of 1.\n* **Machine Learning (ML):** The [ML engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/#machine-learning) accounts for the majority of all detections, human and bot. The ML model leverages Cloudflare's global network, which proxies billions of requests daily, to identify both automated and human traffic. The ML engine produces scores 2 through 99.\n* **Anomaly Detection (AD):** The [AD engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/#anomaly-detection) is an optional detection engine that uses a form of unsupervised learning. Cloudflare records a baseline of a domain's traffic and uses the baseline to intelligently detect outlier requests. Anomaly Detection is user agent-agnostic and can be turned on or off by your account team. Cloudflare does not recommend AD for domains that use [Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/) or expect large amounts of API traffic. The AD engine immediately gives automated requests a score of 1.\n* **JavaScript Detections (JSD)**: The [JSD engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/#javascript-detections) identifies headless browsers and other malicious fingerprints. This engine performs a lightweight, invisible JavaScript injection on the client side of any request. The JSD engine either blocks, challenges, or passes requests to other engines. JSD is enabled by default but is completely optional.\n\n## Bot Dashboards, Analytics, and Logs\n\nCloudflare bot score and bot traffic analysis is available in several locations.\n\n* **Bots dashboard:** Customers can easily see bot activity up to 30 days back and filter on bot score and other bot, traffic, and request filters. The [bot feedback loop](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/feedback-loop/) allows customers to report back to Cloudflare any false positives or false negatives for further investigation.\n\n* **Security Analytics:** Security Analytics brings together all of Cloudflare's detection capabilities in one dashboard and provides a broad view of all traffic across the site. The Bots Likelihood graph and widget provide visibility and allow customers to easily view and filter based on bot score and respective categorization of Automated, Likely Automated, Human, and Likely Human.\n\n* **Events:** Events displays all events the WAF took action on. Events and logs can easily be filtered by bot score and other bot, traffic, or request criteria.\n\n* **Log Explorer:** Customers can use Log Explorer to pull additional detailed log data. Logs can easily be filtered by bot score and other bot, traffic, or request criteria.\n\n* **Log Push:** Customers can also export logs to a third party SIEM or Analytics platform. Bot score, bot score source, bot detection IDs, and bot detection tags can all be exported as part of the logs.\n\n## Bot Management Traffic Flow\n\n![Figure 1: How Cloudflare identifies, scores and processes traffic from bots.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/bot-management-ra-diagram.D8aExrGs_ZeB6zU.svg)\n\n1. Client request is sent to the closest Cloudflare Data Center via anycast ensuring low latency.\n2. Cloudflare applies a layered approach for bot detection; each detection mechanism impacts the bot score assigned by Cloudflare to every request. Every request is assigned a bot score between 1-99 inclusive.\n3. Once the client request has been processed by all of Cloudflare's detection engines and assigned a bot score, defined security policies will be executed, some of which may also be leveraging bot score. Various actions can be taken based on the assigned bot score including the block, allow, rate limit, NoCAPTCHA Challenge.\n4. Cloudflare provides analytics and insights into traffic and requests traversing the Cloudflare network. Customers can use the Bots, Security Analytics, Events, and Log Explorer dashboards to understand the overall traffic and bots activity across their site. Customers can also export logs to third party SIEM and Analytics Platforms.",

This includes focusing on shared content and highlighting active speakers, while participants are shown in small thumbnail views. When you start recording the meeting, it is recorded with the same layout using the default UI kit component called [RtkGrid](https://docs.realtime.cloudflare.com/react-ui-kit/components/rtk-grid).\n\nIf you wish to have a customized layout for your recording application, RealtimeKit's custom recording SDKs provide the flexibility to tailor the appearance of your recordings according to your preferences. You can choose from options like:\n\n* Show only active speaker view\n* Shared screen with thumbnail gallery view\n* Shared screen with large active speaker thumbnail\n* Shared screen without active speaker or gallery view\n* Customized background for your recording\n* Portrait layout, and so on and so forth\n\nLet's dive in to understand the steps involved in creating a custom appearance for your RealtimeKit recording app.\n\nThe custom recording SDKs are used on top of the [UI Kit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit) or [Core SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core). The `RealtimeKitRecording` class is used for managing the recording functionality within the SDK.\n\n## Constructor\n\n`constructor(options)`\n\nCreates an instance of the `RealtimeKitRecording` class.\n\n### Parameters\n\n`options (object)`: The options object.\n\n| **options (object)** | **Description** |\n| - | - |\n| `options.waitTimeMs (number)` | The time (in milliseconds) to wait after all peers have left before leaving the meeting. This option is ignored if `autoStop` is set to true. |\n| `options.autoStart (boolean)` | Set to true if you want to manually call the `startRecording` function. By default, the `autoStart` parameter is set to `true`. If you wish to delay the start of the recording, you can set the value of this parameter to `false`. In that case, you can manually call the `startRecording()` function later. Note that there is a timeout of 2 minutes associated with the `startRecording()` method. If this method is not called within 2 minutes of the WebSocket connection being established, the recording process will encounter an error. |\n| `options.autoStop (boolean)` | Set to true if you want to disable automatic peer leave and manually call the `stopRecording` function. |\n| `options.scanInterval (number)` | The interval (in milliseconds) between scans for automatic peer leave. |\n| `options.devMode (boolean)` | Set to true to enable development mode, which enables logs and disables certain functionality. Also you must ensure that this is set this to true when testing your recording-app locally. |\n\n### Methods",

For example, if you teach an online physics class at 9 a.m. using RealtimeKit, you could add `Physics_9am` to the file name. `Physics_9am_roomname_timestamp` would be the new file name.\n\nFor more information, see [start recording a meeting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/).\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Interactive Recordings with Timed Metadata · Cloudflare Realtime docs\ndescription: Learn how to enable interactive recording with RealtimeKit's\n  capabilities. Follow our guide for effective configuration and management.\nlastUpdated: 2025-12-01T15:18:21.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/interactive-recording/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/interactive-recording/index.md\n---\n\nRealtimeKit's interactive recording feature allows you to add timed metadata to your video stream. Timed metadata serves as cue points for clients to display information and trigger time-aligned actions. The metadata is available to clients in the form of [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3) tags on the playback timeline.\n\n## What is interactive recording?\n\nEver wondered how Netflix displays small images on the seek bar or how additional content is shown while watching a cricket match on Hotstar? It's all metadata inserted at a specific time inside the video feed itself, which is called timed metadata.\n\nTimed metadata is metadata with timestamps. It refers to digital markers added to a video file to provide additional context and information at specific points in the content range. These data points can be inserted into a stream programmatically, using the `interactive_config` in the [Start recording a meeting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/).\n\nOnce RealtimeKit processes the stream, the timed metadata gets synchronized with the audio and video frames. This metadata is available to all viewers during playback at the same time relative to the stream. The timecode acts as a cue point and can trigger specific actions based on the data. For example:\n\nThese features are made possible through the use of ID3 tags that are embedded in the video segments, making them available in the recorded video.\n\n## Add interactivity to your RealtimeKit recordings\n\nTo add interactivity to your RealtimeKit recording, perform the following steps:\n\n1. In the [Start recording a meeting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/), pass the `interactive_config` parameter.\n\nThis parameter enables you to add timed metadata to your recordings, which is made available to clients in HLS format via ID3 tags. The output files are packaged as a tar file.\n\n1. In [RealtimeKitClient](https://docs.realtime.cloudflare.com/web-core/reference/RealtimeKitClient), call the `broadcastMessage` method with the parameters, `ID3` (as a string) and `yourData` (the data you want to send as timed metadata) on the [participants](https://docs.realtime.cloudflare.com/web-core/reference/RealtimeKitClient#module_RealtimeKitClient+participants) object.",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "Note\n\nThis action should only be performed after the recording has been initiated and the system is in the `RECORDING` state. If performed earlier, any associated ID3 tags may be lost.\n\nThe recommended time to perform this action is after the recording indicator has been displayed for 3 to 4 seconds.\n\n1. To stop sending the data, call the following method. Once you make this call, you will no longer be able to send additional ID3 data.",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "If you do not pass this parameter, the ID3 metadata stream will automatically be closed when the recording is stopped.\n\n1. Once the recording is completed, you can retrieve the tar file that contains video segments and a playlist file. The `download_url` provides the link to the tar file. Below is an example screenshot of a tar file:\n\n![Recording Tar Format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/interactive-recording-tar-format.JbEcOmI6_ZMRRWX.webp)\n\nIt's also important to note that the length of each segment depends on the frames of the video. Therefore, each segment may not have the same length, although it is typically close to the specified segment length when the recording was started. By default, the segment length is set to 10 seconds.\n\n1. You can play the stream using the [`hls.js`](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/).",

Follow our guide for effective hierarchy\n  management.\nlastUpdated: 2025-12-08T11:30:45.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/manage-recording-config-hierarchy/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/manage-recording-config-hierarchy/index.md\n---\n\nThis document provides an overview of the precedence structure for managing recording configurations within our system. It explains how various configuration levels interact and prioritize settings. The recording configuration can be defined at three different levels:\n\n* [Start recording a meeting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/)\n* [Create a meeting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/create/)\n* Specified via [Cloudflare RealtimeKit Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/realtime/kit)\n\n## Understand Recording Configuration Precedence\n\nTo comprehend the precedence of recording configurations, it is important to delve into the following details. This understanding becomes crucial when dealing with multiple configurations set through APIs and the developer portal.\n\n| Precedence | Config | Description |\n| - | - | - |\n| 1 | [Start recording API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/) configs | Highest priority in the system. Any settings defined here will take precedence over other configurations. |\n| 2 | [Create a meeting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/create/) configs | Second level of priority in the system. Settings here will supersede Org level config but not Start recording a meeting API configs. |\n| 3 | Specified via Dashboard | Lowest priority in the system. Settings defined here will be overridden by both Start recording a meeting API config and Create a meeting API config. |\n\n## Example Scenario\n\nTo illustrate the precedence order in action, consider the following scenario for the same meeting:\n\n1. Org Level Config specifies that recordings to be stored in the Cloudflare R2 bucket.\n\n2. Create a Meeting API sets recordings to be stored in the AWS S3 storage bucket using the H264 codec.\n\n3. Start recording a meeting API is configured to store recordings in the GCS bucket using the VP8 codec.\n\nIn this scenario, the Start recording a meeting API takes precedence over the Create a Meeting API Config and Org Level Config. As a result, the meeting's recording will be stored in the GCS bucket using VP8 codec, regardless of the defaults set at other levels.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Monitor Recording Status · Cloudflare Realtime docs\ndescription: \"The recording of a meeting can have the following states:\"\nlastUpdated: 2025-12-01T15:18:21.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/monitor-status/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/monitor-status/index.md\n---\n\n## Recording states\n\nThe recording of a meeting can have the following states:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| - | - |\n| INVOKED | Our backend servers have received the recording request, and the master is looking for a ready worker to assign the recording job. |\n| RECORDING | The meeting is currently being recorded by a worker; note that this will also hold true if the meeting is being live streamed. |\n| UPLOADING | The recording has been stopped and the file is being uploaded to the cloud storage. If you have not specified storage details, then the files will be uploaded only to RealtimeKit's server. Any RTMP and livestreaming link will also stop at this stage. |\n| UPLOADED | The recording file upload is complete and the status webhook is also triggered. |\n| ERRORED | There was an irrecoverable error while recording the meeting and the file will not be available. |\n\n## Fetching the state\n\nThere are two ways you can track what state a recording is in or view more details about a recording:\n\n### Using the `recording.statusUpdate` webhook\n\nRealtimeKit sends out a `recording.statusUpdate` webhook each time the recording transitions between states during its lifecycle. Configure webhooks in your RealtimeKit app to receive these notifications.\n\n### By polling HTTP APIs\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the following APIs:\n\n* [List recordings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/get_recordings/): This endpoint gets all past and ongoing recordings linked to a meeting.\n* [Fetch active recording](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/get_active_recordings/): This endpoint gets all ongoing recordings of a meeting.\n* [Fetch details of a recording](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/get_one_recording/): This endpoint gets a specific recording using a recording ID.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Start Recording · Cloudflare Realtime docs\ndescription: This topic explains how to use RealtimeKit to implement composite recording.\nlastUpdated: 2025-12-08T11:30:45.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/start-recording/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/start-recording/index.md\n---\n\nThis topic explains how to use RealtimeKit to implement composite recording.\n\nBefore getting started with this guide, we recommend that you read [Get Started with RealtimeKit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/quickstart/) to familiarize yourself with RealtimeKit.\n\nTo familiarize yourself with the RealtimeKit REST APIs, we recommend exploring the [RealtimeKit REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/).\n\nThere are three ways to start recording a RealtimeKit meeting:\n\n* Using the `record_on_start` flag when [creating a meeting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/create/)\n* Using the [Start Recording API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/)\n* Client side start recording methods on the SDK\n\nRealtimeKit stores recordings for a period of 7 days, after which they will expire and no longer be accessible. It is important to either download a copy of your recording or [set up storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/custom-cloud-storage/) before the link expires.\n\nNote\n\n1. Our system does not currently support recordings of brief durations that are less than five seconds. In such cases, it is possible that the recording APIs may experience occasional failures. Due to limitations in encoding recordings of short duration, these failures may result in an ERRORED state.\n2. Recording will stop if there are no participants in a meeting for 60 seconds.\n3. The average file size for one hour of recording is approximately 300MB.\n4. There can only be one active recording of a meeting at any given time, unless the `allow_multiple_recording` field is set in the [Start Recording API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/).\n5. Maximum recording time is 24 hours. Recording will automatically stop after 24 hours have elapsed since the recording's start time. This option can be configured to any value up to 24 hours by passing the `max_seconds` parameter in the [Start Recording API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/) request.\n\n## Using the `record_on_start` parameter\n\nWhen [creating a meeting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/create/), you can specify the `record_on_start` parameter to start the recording as soon as someone joins the meeting.\n\nSpecify storage config\n\nIf you're using this method to start the recording, you must specify the `storage-config` using the Developer Portal.\n\n### Request\n\nSpecify the `record_on_start` parameter. If this flag is true, then a recording will be started as soon as a meeting starts on RealtimeKit, i.e, when the first participant joins the meeting.",

You can modify and generate your custom icon set from there.\n\nTo replace RealtimeKit's default icon set with your own, pass the link to your icon set in the UI component.\n\n## IconPack reference\n\nThe IconPack is an object where:\n\n* **Object key** - Denotes the name of the icon\n* **Object value** - Stores the SVG string\n\n### Available icons\n\nThe default icon pack includes the following icons:\n\n* `attach`\n* `call_end`\n* `chat`\n* `checkmark`\n* `chevron_down`\n* `chevron_left`\n* `chevron_right`\n* `chevron_up`\n* `clock`\n* `copy`\n* `disconnected`\n* `dismiss`\n* `download`\n* `emoji_multiple`\n* `full_screen_maximize`\n* `full_screen_minimize`\n* `image`\n* `image_off`\n* `join_stage`\n* `leave_stage`\n* `mic_off`\n* `mic_on`\n* `more_vertical`\n* `participants`\n* `people`\n* `pin`\n* `pin_off`\n* `poll`\n* `recording`\n* `rocket`\n* `search`\n* `send`\n* `settings`\n* `share`\n* `share_screen_person`\n* `share_screen_start`\n* `share_screen_stop`\n* `speaker`\n* `spinner`\n* `spotlight`\n* `stop_recording`\n* `subtract`\n* `vertical_scroll`\n* `vertical_scroll_disabled`\n* `video_off`\n* `video_on`\n* `wand`\n* `warning`\n* `wifi`\n\nEach icon in your custom icon pack JSON file should be defined as a key-value pair where the key matches one of the icon names above, and the value is the SVG string for that icon.\n\n## Next steps\n\nExplore additional customization options:\n\n* [Render Default Meeting UI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/) - Complete meeting experience out of the box\n* [Build Your Own UI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/build-your-own-ui/) - Create custom meeting interfaces\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Breakout Rooms · Cloudflare Realtime docs\ndescription: If you prefer to learn by seeing examples, please check out the\n  respective example repositories.\nlastUpdated: 2025-12-30T17:46:42.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/breakout-rooms/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/breakout-rooms/index.md\n---\n\n### Code Examples\n\nIf you prefer to learn by seeing examples, please check out the respective example repositories.\n\n#### Web Examples\n\n* [Web Components](https://github.com/cloudflare/realtimekit-web-examples/tree/main/html-examples/examples/default-meeting-ui)\n* [React](https://github.com/cloudflare/realtimekit-web-examples/tree/main/react-examples/examples/default-meeting-ui)\n* [Angular](https://github.com/cloudflare/realtimekit-web-examples/tree/main/angular-examples/examples/default-meeting-ui)\n\nThe breakout rooms feature, also known as connected meetings, is currently in beta, which means it is still being tested and evaluated, and may undergo some changes.\n\nBreakout rooms allow participants of a meeting to split into smaller groups for targeted discussions and collaboration. With the rise of remote work and online learning, breakout rooms have become an essential tool for enhancing engagement and building community in virtual settings. They are an ideal choice for workshops, online classrooms, or when you need to speak privately with select participants outside the main meeting.\n\nNote\n\nBreakout rooms are currently supported on web only.\n\n## Key features\n\nThe following are some of the key features of RealtimeKit's breakout rooms:\n\n* Manage permissions and privileges of hosts and participants using presets\n* Hosts can create breakout rooms, assign participants, start and close the breakout rooms, and switch between rooms\n* Participants can start and stop video, interact with other participants using chat and polls, and mute/unmute audio\n* Record all breakout sessions individually like any other RealtimeKit meeting\n\n## Roles in a breakout room\n\nRoles in the breakout room are managed by presets.\n\n### Host\n\nHosts can create breakout rooms, assign participants, start and close the breakout rooms, and switch between rooms.\n\n### Participants\n\nAs a participant in a breakout room, you can:\n\n* **Switch to Parent Meeting** - Switch back to the main meeting (if you have the required permissions)\n* **Switch Connected Meetings** - Move from the main meeting to smaller, focused discussion groups (breakout rooms) for collaboration\n* **Collaborate** - Use tools such as chat and polls during breakout sessions\n\n## Audio and video\n\nEach breakout room functions as an independent meeting. When you switch to a breakout room from the main meeting, it automatically switches to the audio and video of the breakout session. You can mute or unmute your audio and start or stop your video at any time during the breakout session, just as you can in the main meeting.\n\nWhen the breakout session ends, your audio and video automatically switch back to the main meeting.\n\n* If your video was turned on during a breakout session, it will remain on when you return to the main session\n* Your audio will be muted when you switch back to the main meeting\n\n## Recording breakout sessions\n\nEach breakout session is a separate session. Each breakout session's recording is stored and managed separately, just like any other RealtimeKit meeting. For more information, refer to [Recording](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore creating breakout rooms:\n\n* **For hosts** - Create a preset with Full Access permissions in Connected Meetings\n* **For participants** - Create a preset with Switch to Parent Meeting and/or Switch Connected Meetings permissions in Connected Meetings\n\n## Create a breakout room\n\nBreakout rooms allow the participants to split into separate sessions. The host can create breakout rooms, assign participants, start and close the breakout rooms.\n\n### Step 1: Create presets\n\nA preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to hosts and participants. They determine the look, feel, and behavior of the breakout room.\n\nFor breakout rooms, you must provide the following permissions for hosts and participants in Connected Meetings:\n\n#### Host\n\nThe host preset should have **Full Access** permission in Connected Meetings. This allows the host to:\n\n* Create breakout rooms\n* Assign participants to rooms\n* Start and close breakout rooms\n* Switch between rooms\n\n#### Participants\n\nYou can choose to provide the following permissions to participants:\n\n* **Switch Connected Meetings** - Allows participants to move between breakout rooms\n* **Switch to Parent Meeting** - Allows participants to return to the main meeting\n\n### Step 2: Save the preset\n\n1. Once you have made all the changes to your preset, click **Save**\n2. Enter a name for your preset and click **Save**\n3. Your preset is listed - click **Edit** to make any changes\n\n### Step 3: Create a meeting\n\nCreate a RealtimeKit meeting using the [Create Meeting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/). This API returns a unique identifier for your meeting.\n\n### Step 4: Add participants\n\nAfter creating the meeting, add each participant using the [Add Participant API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/add_participant/). The `presetName` created earlier must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API request.\n\n### Step 5: Start breakout room\n\n1. In your RealtimeKit meeting, click **Breakout Rooms**\n2. In the Create Breakout dialog, add the number of rooms you want and click **Create**\n\nOnce you have created breakout rooms, assign participants to the rooms. You can either:\n\n* **Assign participants automatically** - RealtimeKit splits participants evenly across rooms\n* **Assign participants manually** - Select which participants you want in each room\n\n#### Assign participants automatically\n\nTo assign participants automatically:\n\n1. In the Assign Participants dialog, click the shuffle button\n2. Participants are assigned to the rooms\n3. Edit room names by clicking the pencil icon beside the room name (optional)\n4. Move participants to different rooms if needed\n5. Click **Start Breakout**\n6. Click **Yes, start** in the confirmation dialog\n\n#### Assign participants manually\n\nTo assign participants manually:\n\n1. In the Assign Participants dialog, select the participants you want to assign to a room\n2. In the Rooms section, click **Assign**\n3. Repeat for all participants and rooms\n4. Click **Start Breakout**\n5. Click **Yes, start** in the confirmation dialog\n\n## Integrate breakout rooms\n\nAfter setting up breakout rooms via the API, you need to integrate them into your application using the RealtimeKit SDK.\n\n### Step 1: Install the SDK\n\nInstall the RealtimeKit SDK:\n\n* Web Components\n\n  Add this script tag to your HTML file:",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "* React",

    },
    {
      "code": "The `meetingChanged` event is triggered when a participant switches between the main meeting and breakout rooms.

    },
    {
      "code": "Note\n\n  The Default Meeting UI (`RtkMeeting` component) automatically joins the session, so you do not need to call `meeting.join()`.\n\nThe `showSetupScreen` property controls whether the setup screen is displayed, allowing participants to preview their audio and video before joining the session.\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou have successfully integrated breakout rooms into your RealtimeKit application. Participants can now:\n\n* Join the main meeting\n* Be assigned to breakout rooms by the host\n* Switch between the main meeting and breakout rooms\n* Collaborate in smaller focused groups\n\nFor more advanced customization, explore the following:\n\n* [UI Kit Components Library](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/component-library/) - Browse available components\n* [UI Kit States](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/state-management/) - Learn how components synchronize\n* [Build Your Own UI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/build-your-own-ui/) - Create custom meeting interfaces\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Build Your Own UI · Cloudflare Realtime docs\ndescription: This guide explains how to use Cloudflare RealtimeKit SDKs to build\n  fully custom real-time video UIs.\nlastUpdated: 2025-12-30T17:46:42.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/build-your-own-ui/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/build-your-own-ui/index.md\n---\n\nThis guide explains how to use Cloudflare RealtimeKit SDKs to build fully custom real-time video UIs.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis page builds upon the [Initialize SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/) and [Render Default Meeting UI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/) & [UI Kit States](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/state-management/) guides.

      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "## State Flow\n\n1. **Child components emit state updates**: When any UI component needs to update state, it emits a state update event\n2. **Meeting component listens and coordinates**: The meeting component listens to all these state update events from its children\n3. **State propagation**: The meeting component propagates the updated state to all other child components to keep them synchronized\n4. **External notification**: The meeting component also emits `rtkStatesUpdate` event that your application can listen to for updating your custom UI or performing actions based on state changes\n\n## Listening to State Updates\n\nTo build custom UI or perform actions based on meeting state changes, you need to listen to the `rtkStatesUpdate` event emitted by the meeting component. This event provides you with the current state of the meeting, including active speaker, participant list, recording status, and more.\n\nNote\n\nStore the states in a state management solution (like React's `useState` or a plain JavaScript object) to alter your UI based on meeting state changes.\n\n## Example Code\n\n## State Properties\n\nThe `rtkStatesUpdate` event provides detailed information about the UI Kit's internal state. Key properties include:\n\n* **`meeting`**: Current meeting state - `'idle'`, `'setup'`, `'joined'`, `'ended'`, or `'waiting'`\n* **`activeSidebar`**: Whether the sidebar is currently open (boolean)\n* **`sidebar`**: Current sidebar section - `'chat'`, `'participants'`, `'polls'`, `'plugins'`, etc.\n* **`activeScreenShare`**: Whether screen sharing UI is active (boolean)\n* **`activeMoreMenu`**: Whether the more menu is open (boolean)\n* **`activeSettings`**: Whether settings panel is open (boolean)\n* **`viewType`**: Current video grid view type (string)\n* **`prefs`**: User preferences object (e.g., `mirrorVideo`, `muteNotificationSounds`)\n* **`roomLeftState`**: State when leaving the room\n* **`activeOverlayModal`**: Active overlay modal configuration object\n* **`activeConfirmationModal`**: Active confirmation modal configuration object\n* **And many more UI state properties**\n\nNote\n\nThese are **UI Kit internal states** for managing the interface. For meeting data like participants, active speaker, or recording status, use the [Core SDK's meeting object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/meeting-object-explained/) directly.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n* **Store states appropriately**: Use React's `useState` hook or a state management library (like Zustand or Redux) for React apps. For vanilla JavaScript, use a reactive state management solution or simple object storage.\n* **Avoid excessive re-renders**: Only update your UI when necessary. In React, consider using `useMemo` or `useCallback` to optimize performance.\n* **Access nested properties safely**: Always check if nested properties exist before accessing them (e.g., `states.sidebar`, `states.prefs?.mirrorVideo`).\n* **Use states for conditional rendering**: Leverage the UI states to show/hide UI elements or respond to interface changes (e.g., showing custom indicators when `states.activeScreenShare` is true).\n* **Understand the difference**: `rtkStatesUpdate` provides **UI Kit internal states** for interface management. For meeting data (participants, active speaker, recording status), use the Core SDK's `meeting` object and its events directly.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: WebSocket adapter · Cloudflare Realtime docs\ndescription: Stream audio and video between WebRTC tracks and WebSocket\n  endpoints.
