      "code": "### A note about multipart upload part sizes\n\nFor multipart uploads, part sizes can significantly affect the number of Class A operations that are used, which can alter how much you end up being charged. Every part upload counts as a separate operation, so larger part sizes will use fewer operations, but might be costly to retry if the upload fails. Also consider that a multipart upload is always going to consume at least 3 times as many operations as a single `PutObject`, because it will include at least one `CreateMultipartUpload`, `UploadPart` & `CompleteMultipartUpload` operations.\n\nBalancing part size depends heavily on your use-case, but these factors can help you minimize your bill, so they are worth thinking about.\n\nYou can configure rclone's multipart upload part size using the `--s3-chunk-size` CLI argument. Note that you might also have to adjust the `--s3-upload-cutoff` argument to ensure that rclone is using multipart uploads. Both of these can be set in your configuration file as well. Generally, `--s3-upload-cutoff` will be no less than `--s3-chunk-size`.",
