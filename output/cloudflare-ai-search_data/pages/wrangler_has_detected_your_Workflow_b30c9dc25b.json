An instance will run to completion (success or failure).\n3. Deploying newer versions of a Workflow will cause all instances after that point to run the newest Workflow code.\n\nNote\n\nBecause Workflows can be long running, it is possible to have running instances that represent different versions of your Workflow code over time.\n\nTo trigger our Workflow, we will use the `wrangler` CLI and pass in an optional `--payload`.
