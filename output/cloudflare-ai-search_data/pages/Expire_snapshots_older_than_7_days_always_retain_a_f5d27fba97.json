  "content": "npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog snapshot-expiration enable my-bucket \\\n  --older-than-days 7 \\\n  --retain-last 10\n```\n\nSnapshot expiration uses two parameters to determine which snapshots to remove:\n\n* `--older-than-days`: age threshold in days\n* `--retain-last`: minimum snapshot count to retain\n\nBoth conditions must be met before a snapshot is expired, ensuring you always retain recent snapshots even if they exceed the age threshold.\n\nThis feature complements [automatic compaction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/table-maintenance/), which optimizes query performance by combining small data files into larger ones. Together, these automatic maintenance operations keep your Iceberg tables performant and cost-efficient without manual intervention.\n\nTo learn more about snapshot expiration and how to configure it, visit our [table maintenance documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/table-maintenance/) or see [how to manage catalogs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/manage-catalogs/).\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: WAF Release - 2025-12-18 · Changelog\ndescription: Cloudflare WAF managed rulesets 2025-12-18 release\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-12-18-waf-release/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-12-18-waf-release/index.md\n---",
