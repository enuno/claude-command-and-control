Raw fields, prefixed with `raw.`, preserve original request values for later evaluations. These fields are immutable during the entire request evaluation workflow, and they are not affected by the actions of previously matched rules.\n\n**Note**: This raw field may include some basic normalization done by Cloudflare's HTTP server. However, this can change in the future.\n\n* Request\n* URI\n* Raw fields\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: raw.http.request.uri.args · Cloudflare Ruleset Engine docs\ndescription: The raw HTTP URI arguments associated with a request represented as\n  a Map (associative array).\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/raw.http.request.uri.args/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/raw.http.request.uri.args/index.md\n---",
