By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n   parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n   notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n   a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n   License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n   does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n   the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n   cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n   customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n   to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n   received the program in object code or executable form with such\n   an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n   (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n   GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n   with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n   under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1.]\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n   charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n   in the event an application does not supply such function or\n   table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n   its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n   application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n   application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n   root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n   uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n   executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n   to use the modified definitions.)\n\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n   Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n   copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n   rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n   will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n   the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n   interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n   least three years, to give the same user the materials\n   specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n   than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n   specified materials from the same place.\n\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n   based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n   facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n   Sections above.\n\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n   that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n   where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n   modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n   version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Review the information here to learn more.\nlastUpdated: 2025-10-31T13:37:27.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/anti-replay-protection/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/anti-replay-protection/index.md\n---\n\nIf you use Magic WAN and anycast IPsec tunnels, we recommend disabling anti-replay protection. Cloudflare disables this setting by default. However, you can enable it through the API or the Cloudflare dashboard for devices that do not support disabling it, including Cisco Meraki, Velocloud, and AWS VPN Gateway.\n\nRefer to [Add tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/#add-tunnels) to learn how to set up replay protection. This page explains replay attacks, why Cloudflare recommends disabling IPsec anti-replay, and related considerations.\n\n## Replay attacks\n\nReplay attacks occur when a malicious actor intercepts and records a [packet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/), and later sends the recorded packet to the target network again with an intent that benefits the attacker.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a poorly designed Internet of Things (IoT) garage door opener. The device has a simple protocol for operation: A User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet contains the garage door password and either `open` or `shut` in its data segment. The garage door's key encrypts the data segment, and the owner's phone sends it to either open or close the garage door.\n\nAn attacker likely cannot open or close the garage door by guessing the encryption key and password. While the attacker cannot see the recorded packet's encrypted content, if the garage is in their line-of-sight, they could potentially correlate and guess which packets are responsible for opening the garage door. When the attacker wants to open the door, they send the recorded `open` packet, and because the recorded packet would contain the password and already be encrypted with the right key, this door would open.\n\nTo prevent this replay attack, a user could add a packet number to each command sent to the garage door. The first could be `packet 1`, the second `packet 2` and so on, and the garage door would only accept packets containing the next number in the sequence each time. For example, after the garage door receives `packet 1`, it would only accept packet 2, and if an attacker tries to replay `packet 1`, the garage door ignores the request.\n\n## IPsec anti-replay protection\n\nIPsec anti-replay protection works similarly to the prevention example in the scenario above. The sender assigns each IPsec packet a sequence number. The receiver tracks which sequence numbers it has already seen and only accepts packets in a small window around the highest value the receiver has seen, and the window is typically 64-1024 packets. IPsec uses a window instead of strict sequencing because sometimes packets are reordered or lost on the Internet - having a range of acceptable packet sequence numbers helps absorb these issues.\n\n## Magic WAN and anti-replay protection\n\nCloudflare's global anycast network consists of thousands of servers in hundreds of data centers around the world. Similar to Cloudflare's anycast GRE tunnel implementation, Cloudflare's IPsec implementation is also anycast, which enables users to enjoy all the benefits of Cloudflare's anycast network architecture. These benefits include unparalleled performance and low latency, greatly simplified configuration and management, and native network resiliency with automatic failover. By default, any packet for Magic WAN can go through any one of these servers where Cloudflare encrypts and encapsulates it with IPsec and sends it to your router.\n\nEngineers did not design IPsec anti-replay protection for such a distributed scenario - they designed the protection scheme for a single sender and single receiver. For a single sender, keeping track of the sequence number is trivial, and the sender stores the sequence number in memory and increments it for every packet sent. If you enable replay protection for Magic WAN IPsec tunnels, Cloudflare routes packets for a single tunnel to one server that keeps track of the sequence number. This means the replay protection mechanism will work correctly, but you lose the benefits of automatically distributing traffic across Cloudflare's global servers. It also only works in one direction (Cloudflare to customer network) - Cloudflare will not route packets from the customer network to Cloudflare to a single server, and will not apply replay protection.\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nIPsec anti-replay protection is extremely important for transport mode - host-to-host or even app-to-app IPsec. In transport mode, an attacker has a relatively easy time identifying the encrypted protocol and identifying which packets to replay if the protocol is even subject to replay attacks. Magic WAN, however, uses tunnel mode, which is inherently much harder to successfully manage a replay attack.\n\nThere are several reasons that make replay attacks difficult with tunnel mode:\n\n* IPsec encrypts the entire inner packet, which means the attacker would know almost nothing about the user packet they capture and perform correlation for replay attack. The only information an attacker would know is the outer site network that encrypted the packet, the outer site network that receives it, and the approximate size of the packet. However, this information is not enough to identify specific inner user packet flows to correlate and replay.\n* Replay attacks only work when attackers use the same encryption keys. After rekeying, the router drops old replayed packets.\n* Most protocols are not susceptible to replay at the packet level. The Internet can duplicate packets, which means TCP and many protocols built on UDP already include sequence numbers or similar to handle duplicate packets coming off the wire. For those, the replay traffic just looks like a duplicate packet and is handled by the end host correctly.\n* Anti-replay protection is available in a higher Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer. Many modern day applications use secure communication protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), or SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to transport application data. These secure communication protocols (at a higher OSI layer than network layer) natively support anti-replay protection.\n* The reduced attack surface lowers the probability for packet interception. IPsec tunnels are site-to-site VPN tunnels between a user's site router and Cloudflare's global network, through dedicated Internet Service Provider (ISP) network connections, which are typically very secure. Additionally, the anycast nature of Cloudflare's IPsec implementation terminates the IPsec tunnel to one of the more than 300 Cloudflare data centers closest to the customer's edge router, which minimizes the physical distance and footprint the encrypted packets have to traverse.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Device compatibility · Cloudflare One docs\ndescription: Magic WAN is compatible with any device that supports IPsec with\n  the supported configuration parameters or supports GRE.\nlastUpdated: 2025-11-19T12:29:18.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/device-compatibility/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/device-compatibility/index.md\n---\n\nMagic WAN is compatible with any device that supports IPsec with the [supported configuration parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/gre-ipsec-tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters) or supports GRE.\n\nThe matrix below includes example devices and links to the integration guides.\n\n| Appliance | GRE tunnel | IPsec tunnel |\n| - | - | - |\n| [Aruba EdgeConnect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/aruba-edgeconnect/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Cisco ASA | Compatibility on roadmap | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) |\n| [Cisco IOS XE](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/cisco-ios-xe/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Cisco Meraki | Compatibility on roadmap | Compatibility on roadmap |\n| [Cisco SD-WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/viptela/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n| [Fortinet](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/fortinet/) | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) | ✅ |\n| [Furukawa Electric FITELnet](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/fitelnet/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Juniper Networks SRX Series Firewalls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/juniper/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/palo-alto/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n| [pfSense](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/pfsense/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Prisma SD-WAN (Palo Alto) | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) |\n| Riverbed | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) |\n| [SonicWall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/sonicwall/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Sophos Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/sophos-firewall/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n| [strongSwan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/strongswan/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Ubiquiti](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/ubiquiti/) | - | ✅ |\n| Velocloud | Compatibility on roadmap | Compatibility on roadmap |\n| Versa | Specifications compatible[1](#user-content-fn-1) | Compatibility on roadmap |\n| [VyOS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/vyos/) | ✅ | ✅ |\n\n| VPN | GRE tunnel | IPsec tunnel |\n| - | - | - |\n| [Alibaba Cloud VPN Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/alibaba-cloud/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Amazon AWS Transit Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/aws/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Azure VPN Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/azure/) | - | ✅ |\n| [GCP Cloud VPN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/google/) | - | ✅ |\n| [Oracle Cloud](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/third-party/oracle/) | - | ✅ |\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

Cloudflare sets up tunnel endpoints on global network servers inside your network namespace, and you set up tunnel endpoints on routers at your data center.\n\nTo accommodate additional header data introduced by encapsulation, you must adjust the maximum segment size (MSS) to comply with the standard Internet routable maximum transmission unit (MTU), which is 1500 bytes.\n\nFor instructions, refer to [Set maximum segment size](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/get-started/#set-maximum-segment-size).\n\nThis diagram illustrates the flow of traffic with Magic WAN.",

    {
      "code": "Note\n\nBy default, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) interface routes egress packets, not Cloudflare.\n\n## Anycast\n\nMagic WAN uses [anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) IP addresses for Cloudflare's tunnel endpoints. In the anycast model, any server in any data center can receive traffic and must be capable of encapsulating and decapsulating packets for any tunnel.\n\nThis works with GRE tunnels because the GRE protocol is stateless. Cloudflare processes each packet independently without requiring any negotiation or coordination between tunnel endpoints. Tunnel endpoints bind to IP addresses but not to specific devices. Any device that can strip off the outer headers and then route the inner packet can handle any GRE packet sent over the tunnel.\n\nFor IPsec tunnels, the customer's router negotiates the creation of an IPsec tunnel with Cloudflare using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. Next, the Cloudflare server that handled that negotiation will propagate the details of that newly created IPsec tunnel (traffic selectors, keys, etc.) across Cloudflare's data centers. The result is that any Cloudflare server can then handle traffic for that IPsec tunnel, even though only one Cloudflare server actually negotiated the setup of that tunnel.\n\nCloudflare's anycast architecture provides a conduit to your tunnel for every server in every data center on Cloudflare's global network.

      "code": "## IPsec tunnels\n\n[IPsec](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/) is a group of protocols that work together to set up encrypted connections between devices. It helps keep data you send over public networks secure. Organizations often use IPsec to set up Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and it works by encrypting IP packets and authenticating the source where the packets come from.\n\nFor information on how to set up an IPsec tunnel, refer to [Configure tunnel endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/). To learn more about the configuration parameters Magic WAN uses to create an IPsec tunnel, keep reading.\n\n### How IKEv2 establishes an IPsec tunnel\n\nMagic WAN uses the following stages to establish an IPsec tunnel:\n\n* **Initial Exchange** (`IKE_SA_INIT`): IKE peers negotiate parameters for the IKE Security Association (SA) and establish a shared secret for key derivation. After this exchange, the peers have a secure communication channel but they have not yet authenticated each other. If supported, the peers will also perform Network Address Translation (NAT) detection in this exchange.\n* **Auth Exchange** (`IKE_AUTH`): Using the secure tunnel from the initial exchange, IKE peers mutually authenticate each other. After authentication, they establish the IKE security association (SA). Next, the peers negotiate and establish an IPsec tunnel, known as a Child SA.\n\nNote\n\nThe IKE SA and the Child SA are separate things, each with their own parameters. The Child SA is the actual IPsec tunnel where user traffic flows (that is, the dataplane). The IKE SA sets up and manages the Child SA.\n\nIn summary, IKEv2 creates an IKE SA that uses certain cryptographic transforms. It then uses that IKE SA to create a Child SA which itself uses certain cryptographic transforms. The following configuration section details which of these transforms Magic WAN currently supports for IKE SAs and Child SAs.\n\nNote\n\nInternet Key Exchange (IKE) is one of the protocols that makes up IPsec. Cloudflare only operates as an IKE responder.\n\n### Supported configuration parameters\n\nChoose from the following configuration parameters Magic WAN supports based on what your appliance supports.\n\nIKE SA (also known as Phase 1)\n\nDocumentation sometimes refers to IKE SA as Phase 1 as per IKEv1 language.\n\n* **Encryption**\n\n  * AES-GCM-16 with 128-bit or 256-bit key length\n  * AES-CBC with 256-bit key length\n\n* **Integrity** (sometimes referred to as Authentication)\n\n  * SHA2-256\n\n* **Diffie-Hellman group**: Cloudflare supports the following Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups.\n\n  * DH group 20 (384-bit random ECP group)\n\n  * DH group 14 (2048-bit MODP group)\n\n  * DH group 5 (1536-bit MODP group)\n\n    Warning\n\n    Cloudflare recommends that you use only one DH group when configuring your device, specifically **DH group 20**.\n\n* **Pseudorandom function (PRF)**\n\n  Not to be confused with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). You often cannot configure PRF.\n\n  * SHA2-256\n  * SHA2-384\n  * SHA2-512\n\nChild SA (also known as Phase 2 or IPsec SA)\n\nThe Child SA. Documentation sometimes refers to this as Phase 2 as per IKEv1 language.\n\n* **Encryption**:\n\n  * AES-GCM-16 with 128-bit or 256-bit key length\n  * AES-CBC with 128-bit or 256-bit key length\n\n* **Integrity** (sometimes referred to as Authentication.)\n\n  * SHA2-256\n  * SHA-1\n\n  Note\n\n  When using AES-GCM-16, you do not need an integrity algorithm because AES GCM includes integrity checking (since it is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm). Even when using an AEAD algorithm, however, some routers still require you to select an integrity algorithm.\n\n* **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) group**\n\n  Documentation sometimes refers to this as Phase 2 Diffie-Hellman Group. Not to be confused with PRF. Cloudflare supports the following Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups.\n\n  * DH group 20 (384-bit random ECP group)\n\n  * DH group 14 (2048-bit MODP group)\n\n  * DH group 5 (1536-bit MODP group)\n\n    Warning\n\n    Cloudflare recommends that you use only one DH group when configuring your device, specifically **DH group 20**.\n\nRequired configuration parameters\n\n* The IKE version must be IKEv2.\n* The IKE authentication method must be Pre-Shared Key (PSK).\n* If your router is behind Network Address Translation (NAT) and requires NAT traversal (NAT-T), then your router must initiate IKE communication on port `4500`. Most devices support configuring NAT-T to begin on port `4500` (exceptions include at least some versions of the Cisco ASA). Cloudflare does not support NAT-T for IKE sessions which begin on port `500` and then switch to port `4500`.\n* (Uncommon) You must disable Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN).\n* If your tunnels need replay protection, enable Dead Peer Detection (DPD) in your router and select the option that restarts your IKE session when a DPD timeout occurs. This \"restart\" option ensures that the connection can recover in the event that a Cloudflare server goes offline. If your router does not offer this setting, check the router documentation for its dead peer detection behavior.\n\nOptional configuration parameters\n\n* Disable [anti-replay protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/anti-replay-protection/).\n* **`NULL` encryption for IPsec:** Do not use this option unless necessary because it reduces security by leaving IPsec traffic unencrypted. You must explicitly opt in to use this option.\n\n### Supported IKE ID formats\n\nMagic WAN supports the following IKE ID types for IPsec:\n\nRequest for Comments (RFC) name `ID_RFC822_ADDR`\n\n* **Format**: `ipsec@<TUNNEL_ID>.<ACCOUNT_ID>.ipsec.cloudflare.com`\n* **Example**: `ipsec@f5407d8db1a542b196c59f6d04ba8bd1.123456789.ipsec.cloudflare.com`\n\nRFC name `ID_FQDN`\n\n* **Format**: `<TUNNEL_ID>.<ACCOUNT_ID>.ipsec.cloudflare.com`\n* **Example**: `f5407d8db1a542b196c59f6d04ba8bd1.123456789.ipsec.cloudflare.com`\n\nRFC name `ID_KEY_ID`\n\n* **Format**: `<ACCOUNT_ID>_<TUNNEL_ID>`\n* **Example**: `123456789_f5407d8db1a542b196c59f6d04ba8bd1`\n\nAdditionally, Cloudflare supports the IKE ID type of `ID_IPV4_ADDR` if the following two conditions are met:\n\n1. You set the IPsec tunnel's `customer_endpoint` value.\n2. The combination of `cloudflare_endpoint` and `customer_endpoint` is unique among the customer's IPsec tunnels.\n\nWarning\n\nMake sure each IPsec tunnel has a unique combination of a [Cloudflare endpoint and customer endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/). If this combination is not unique among your IPsec tunnels, you should use one of the custom IKE formats (`ID_RFC822_ADDR`, `ID_FQDN`, or `ID_KEY_ID`) to specify the tunnel ID and account ID. This helps Cloudflare link the IKE packet to the right IPsec tunnel for tasks like authentication.\n\n### Route-based vs. policy-based VPNs\n\nAlthough Cloudflare supports both route-based and policy-based VPNs, we recommend route-based VPNs.\n\nIf route-based VPNs are not an option and you must use policy-based VPNs, be aware of the following limitations:\n\n* Cloudflare only supports a single set of traffic selectors per Child SA.\n* A policy must cover reply-style health checks — that is, they must match traffic selectors — otherwise, Cloudflare drops them, just like any other traffic from an IPsec tunnel that does not match a policy.\n* A single IPsec tunnel can only contain around 100 Child SAs. Therefore, there is effectively a limit on the number of different policies per tunnel.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: How Cloudflare calculates tunnel health alerts · Cloudflare One docs\ndescription: Cloudflare combines different metrics to determine when to send you\n  Magic Tunnel health alerts.

The following sections explain the key concepts behind this process.\n\n### Service-level indicator (SLI)\n\nThe ratio of positive events to total events. An SLI of 0% means the feature is not working at all, and an SLI of 100% means the feature is fully working as expected.\n\nNote\n\nCloudflare counts degraded health checks as failed health checks when calculating SLIs.\n\n### Service-level objectives (SLOs)\n\nSLOs are the threshold for the SLI and set a target level of reliability for Magic Tunnels. For example, an SLO could be 99.9% of tunnel states being healthy over the past 30 days. Cloudflare calculates the SLI values for the SLO based on the [`down` tunnel state value](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/tunnel-health-checks/#tunnel-state-determination), not on the timeout results from tunnel health checks.\n\n### Error budget\n\nThe error budget is the amount of unsuccessful events that can happen over the course of the SLO time window while maintaining the service at the level of availability the SLO defines.\n\nThe SLO is a target percentage, and the error budget equals 100% minus the SLO. For example, assume that during 30 days there were one million Magic Tunnel health checks in your account, and your SLO is set to 99.9%. The error budget for this case would be:",
      "language": "unknown"
    },
    {
      "code": "This means the SLO allows for 1,000 unsuccessful Magic health checks over the course of 30 days. However, what happens if all errors happen in one hour instead of 30 days? This leads to the concept of burn rate.\n\n### Burn rate\n\nThe burn rate measures how fast you expend the error budget over a given time window relative to the SLO window. In the example, an SLO of 99.9% means you can observe 1,000 Magic health check failures over the course of 30 days. However, those same 1,000 health check failures are not acceptable during one hour.\n\n## When Cloudflare alerts you\n\nTo determine when to send Magic Tunnel health alerts, Cloudflare relies on a multi-window, multi-burn rate approach. Every five minutes, Cloudflare analyzes the last hour and the last five minutes of data. Cloudflare calculates the SLI for the short window (five minutes) and long window (one hour) of data.\n\nCloudflare only alerts you when both the short and long windows fall below the configured threshold. This means both windows must fail the threshold for an alert to trigger. For example, if you defined a threshold of 99%:\n\n* Short window: 99.2%, Long window: 99%. Cloudflare would not trigger an alert because the short window is above the 99% threshold.\n* Short window: 98%, Long window: 98%. Cloudflare would trigger an alert because both windows are below the 99% threshold.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Maximum transmission unit and maximum segment size · Cloudflare One docs\ndescription: Magic WAN has operation requirements that customers need to\n  understand to ensure their network functions as intended.

Pay particular attention to the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and maximum segment size (MSS) values. Incorrect configuration of these values can cause performance loss or prevent data [packet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) delivery.\n\n## MTU and MSS\n\nThe [maximum transmission unit (MTU)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mtu/) is a measurement representing the largest data packet that a network-connected device will accept. The MTU almost always applies to Layer 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model in networking and includes the entire packet, including all headers (Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), etc.) and the data (payload) itself. For example, packets must not exceed 1,500 bytes to route through the Internet.\n\nThe [maximum segment size (MSS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mss/) refers to the amount of data that you can send in a single TCP datagram packet. You determine this value by subtracting the size of the IP and TCP headers from the MTU, which instructs the router how large the payload can be. It applies to Layer 4 of the OSI model in networking.\n\nOne common misconception about MSS/MTU is that setting these values negatively impacts performance. While there is a slight performance penalty, it is worse not to configure these values to account for the specificities of your network.\n\n## Encapsulation\n\nSince Magic WAN uses encapsulation to deliver its services, it is also important to understand why MTU and MSS matter in this case.\n\nEncapsulation adds bytes to the packet because Cloudflare adds a new IP header and (often) some sort of encapsulating header to every packet. For example, in the case of Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), encapsulation adds 24 bytes — 20 bytes for the IPv4 header and 4 bytes for the GRE tunnel header.\n\nA network interface that performs GRE encapsulation needs to account for the added overhead by reducing its MTU. Since the MTU maximum size is 1,500 bytes, for IPv4 this means the MTU becomes 1,476 bytes (the original 1,500 bytes minus the 24 bytes from the GRE encapsulation). This reduced MTU defines the maximum size of the IP packet that GRE can encapsulate.\n\n## Fragmentation\n\nIf the data packet is larger than what the network interface can accept, the network must either drop or fragment it into smaller packets. When fragmentation occurs, Cloudflare only accepts data packets that it can completely reassemble. If some fragments are missing, Cloudflare discards all received fragments. Cloudflare does not forward incomplete packets to the customer.\n\nSetting the do not fragment (DF) bit in the TCP header to `1` denotes that the network must drop the packet rather than fragment it if the packet is larger than the MTU that intermediary network devices can accept. Most TCP implementations set the DF bit to `1` to avoid the potential issues that fragmentation causes.\n\nIf you experience issues with fragmentation and cannot set an MSS clamp, Cloudflare can clear the DF bit for you. When you enable this option, Cloudflare fragments packets greater than 1,500 bytes, and your infrastructure reassembles the packets after decapsulation. Use this as a last resort option. Contact your account team for more information.\n\n### Fragmentation in Magic WAN\n\nConsider a UDP datagram of size 3,000 bytes (8 bytes for the UDP header + 2,992 bytes for the UDP data). To fit within a standard 1,500-byte MTU, this UDP datagram would be fragmented across three IP packets as follows:\n\n![A diagram showing a UDP datagram and its various components.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/udp-datagram.CfIb9Urm_17Vmij.webp)\n\nSuppose that the UDP datagram has source port `389` and is destined for a Magic WAN customer IP address. Suppose also that the Magic WAN customer has a firewall rule in place that drops UDP traffic with source port `389`, a common [Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-reflections) reflection attack vector.\n\nThe three packet fragments above will arrive at Cloudflare, but only the first fragment contains a UDP header with source port information. The second and third fragments contain UDP data but do not have UDP header information.\n\nSo the question is: which of these fragments does Cloudflare drop and which does it deliver to the customer? If Cloudflare only drops the first parts of fragmented packets, the remaining parts could still generate a large amount of traffic during a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.\n\n### How Cloudflare handles fragments\n\nThe following diagram shows how the three UDP fragments in the preceding example flow through Cloudflare and Magic WAN. The main takeaways are:\n\n* **Cloudflare never sends incomplete packets to customers**: If Cloudflare does not see all parts of a packet required to fully reassemble that packet, Cloudflare will not send the partial data fragments to the customer.\n* **Magic Firewall operates on fully reassembled packets, not individual fragments**: This means that filters that match on UDP/TCP header information, for example, apply to the fully reassembled packet, not just the initial fragment. Cloudflare will not leak non-initial fragments to customers.\n* **Customers can still see fragmented packets**: By default (without `clear_dont_fragment_bit` set), Cloudflare fragments packets to fit within the configured MTU of the tunnel before sending the data to the customer. If a packet is larger than 1,476 bytes, Cloudflare will fragment it and send those fragments to the customer for reassembly.\n\nIn all cases, Cloudflare sends all fragments to the customer.\n\n![A diagram showing how Cloudflare handles fragmentation.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/fragmentation.BPC0EONl_Z2gglCH.webp)\n\n## MSS clamping\n\nMaximum segment size (MSS) is a TCP setting that limits the size of TCP segments. The SYN packets set this option during the three-way handshake.\n\nBy default, a TCP endpoint sets its MSS value based on its local network interface MTU. For example, for IPv4, if the MTU is 1,500 bytes then MSS becomes 1,460 bytes (1,500 bytes minus 20 bytes from the IPv4 header minus 20 bytes from the TCP header).\n\nMSS is a tool that you can use to configure TCP packet size behavior. If a TCP endpoint sits behind a network with reduced MTU, changing the MSS value to match the actual path MTU value forces remote endpoints to send packets that fit within the specified MTU. So, if an IPv4 TCP endpoint sits behind a GRE tunnel with an MTU of 1,476 bytes, the MSS value in its TCP SYN packets should be 1,436 bytes - 1,476 bytes minus the 20 bytes from the IPv4 header, minus the 20 bytes from the TCP header.\n\nOne way to modify the MSS setting is by changing the MTU of the network interface in the router's WAN interface to match the path MTU. Another way to modify MSS is by applying an MSS clamp, where you configure an intermediary network device - such as a router - to modify the MSS TCP option on-the-fly when packets pass through it. Note that changing the MTU on the interface of an intermediary network device is not the same as applying an MSS clamp, and it does not change the TCP MSS value.\n\nRefer to [MSS clamping recommendations](#mss-clamping-recommendations) for information on what you should set your MSS clamping to, depending on the type of tunnel.\n\nWarning\n\nCloudflare only recommends applying a MSS clamp to adjust the size of TCP packets. Changing the MTU of a network interface is not recommended as this might have unforeseen impacts on traffic.\n\n## MSS clamping recommendations\n\n### GRE tunnels as off-ramp\n\nThe MSS value depends on how your network is set up.\n\n* **On your edge router**: Apply the clamp to the GRE tunnel internal interface (meaning where the egress traffic will traverse). Set the MSS clamp to 1,436 bytes. Your devices may do this automatically once the tunnel is configured, but it depends on your devices.\n\n### IPsec tunnels\n\nFor IPsec tunnels, the value you need to specify depends on how your network is set up. The MSS clamping value is lower than for GRE tunnels because the physical interface sees IPsec-encrypted packets, not TCP packets, and MSS clamping does not apply to those.\n\n* **On your edge router**: Apply this on your IPsec tunnel internal interface (meaning where the egress traffic will traverse). Your devices may do this automatically once the tunnel is configured, but it depends on your devices. Set the TCP MSS clamp to 1,360 bytes maximum.\n\n</page>\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: Traffic steering · Cloudflare One docs\ndescription: Magic WAN uses a static configuration to route traffic through\n  anycast tunnels using the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and Internet\n  Protocol Security (IPsec) protocols from Cloudflare's global network to your\n  network.\nlastUpdated: 2025-11-04T17:07:51.000Z\nchatbotDeprioritize: false\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/traffic-steering/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/traffic-steering/index.md\n---\n\n## Magic routing table\n\nThe Magic networking routing table is a virtual network overlay, private to your account, that spans all Cloudflare data centers globally. This overlay network provides:\n\n* Magic Transit delivery for [Denial of Service (DoS)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/) and [Magic Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-firewall/) filtered Internet traffic, from the entry data center where the traffic ingressed, to your publicly addressed edge/border network.\n* Magic WAN packet transport between Magic tunnels, interconnects, [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/), and [Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) connections such as [WARP Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/), [Remote Browser Isolation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/), [Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/), and [Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/).\n\nThe Magic routing table supports routing the Magic WAN traffic through anycast tunnels using [GRE and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/reference/gre-ipsec-tunnels/) or [CNI with Dataplane v2 (beta)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/). You can add entries to the Magic routing table through static route configuration or through routes learned through BGP peering (only available over CNI with Dataplane v2 (beta)). Traffic can also be routed automatically according to tracked flow state.\n\n### Allowed IP ranges\n\nThe following IPv4 address ranges are allowed in the Magic Routing table:\n\n* [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) address space, specifically `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16`.\n\nWhen using Magic WAN and Cloudflare Tunnel together, consider the IP ranges utilized in the static routes of Cloudflare Tunnel when selecting static routes for Magic WAN. For more information, refer to [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/zero-trust/cloudflare-tunnel/).\n\nFor prefixes outside RFC 1918, contact your Cloudflare customer service manager.\n\n### Route prioritization\n\nMagic WAN steers traffic along tunnel routes based on route entry priorities.\n\n* Lower values have greater priority.\n\n* When the priority values for prefix entries match, Cloudflare uses [equal-cost multi-path (ECMP)](#equal-cost-multi-path-routing) packet forwarding to route traffic. You can apply an optional weight value to static routes to [modify ECMP tunnel distribution](#set-priority-and-weights-for-static-routes).\n\n* Cloudflare routing applies longest-prefix match. A more specific static route (like `/30`) always takes precedence over a less specific one (like `/29`), regardless of tunnel priority — unless you remove the more specific route.\n\n* When BGP and static routes have the same prefix and priority, Cloudflare enforces priority by preferring static routes over BGP routes. This ensures that manually configured static routes take precedence unless you explicitly deprioritize them.\n\n### Set priority and weights for static routes\n\nThe priority value for static routes is directly configured as part of the route object in the Cloudflare [dashboard or through the API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/wan-tunnels/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-routes/#create-a-static-route). For example:\n\n| Prefix | NextHop | Priority |\n| - | - | - |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_1_IAD` | `200` |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_2_IAD` | `200` |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_3_ATL` | `100` |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_4_ATL` | `100` |\n\nIn this example, tunnels with priority of `100` are preferred to tunnels with priority of `200` because lower numbers have greater priority.\n\nOptionally, you can assign weights to distribute traffic more effectively among multiple tunnels. Weight values determine traffic proportion, with higher weights receiving more traffic. The maximum weight value is `256`.\n\nIn the following example, `TUNNEL_2_IAD` is likely to receive twice as much traffic as `TUNNEL_1_IAD`.\n\n| Prefix | NextHop | Priority | Weight |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_1_IAD` | `100` | `64` |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_2_IAD` | `100` | `128` |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_3_ATL` | `100` | `192` |\n| `10.10.10.100/24` | `TUNNEL_4_ATL` | `100` | `255` |\n\nAside from priority, scoping static routes to specific geographic regions will also impact how traffic is steered. Refer to [Scoping routes to specific regions](#scoping-routes-to-specific-regions) for more details.\n\n### Set priority for BGP routes\n\nWhen BGP advertises a route, Cloudflare automatically adds it to the Magic routing table with a default priority of `100` which applies to [all regions](#scoping-routes-to-specific-regions). However, if a static route exists with the same prefix and priority, the static route always takes precedence over the BGP route. Set a different priority for static routes (more or less than `100`) depending on which you want to prioritize. Lower values have greater priority.\n\nAdditionally, when multiple BGP routes exist with the same prefix length and priority, ECMP distributes traffic across them using [equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing](#equal-cost-multi-path-routing).\n\n### Change route priorities with BGP attributes\n\nCloudflare supports traffic engineering through BGP communities and AS prepending. You can use these traffic routing techniques to set route priorities and perform traffic engineering across multiple interconnects.\n\n#### BGP communities for setting route priority\n\nThe default BGP route priority is `100`. This base priority can be adjusted using communities. For example, when a route is tagged with the community `13335:60010` its priority is set to `10`. This makes it a higher priority than the default of `100` because lower numeric priorities are preferred.\n\nThe community values supported for setting base route priority are:\n\n* `13335:60010`: Set base Magic route priority to `10`\n* `13335:60050`: Set base Magic route priority to `50`\n* `UNSET`: Set base Magic route priority to `100`\n* `13335:60150`: Set base Magic route priority to `150`\n* `13335:60200`: Set base Magic route priority to `200`\n* `13335:60901`: Set base Magic route priority to `501000`\n* `13335:60902`: Set base Magic route priority to `1001000`\n\nSetting multiple base priority communities in the same prefix update message is a misconfiguration. In this situation, Cloudflare prefers the highest priority (lowest integer value).\n\n#### AS path prepending for adjusting route priority\n\nFor each additional mention of your ASN in the received AS path, Cloudflare adds `10` to the route's base priority. By increasing the priority number, the route becomes less preferred.\n\nFor example, if your ASN is `65000` then the `BGP UPDATE` to Cloudflare will be:",
