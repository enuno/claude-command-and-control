This includes scanning your assets directory, computing hashes for each file, generating a manifest with file metadata, and calling the Cloudflare API to upload any missing files in chunks. We support large directories with parallel uploads and chunking, and when the asset manifest hash changes, we detect what's changed and trigger an upload for *only* those changed files.\n\n* Get started with [the Cloudflare Terraform provider (v5.11.0)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/5.11.0/docs)\n* You can use either the existing [`cloudflare_workers_script` resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/workers_script) to upload your Worker code and assets in one resource.\n* Or you can use the new beta [`cloudflare_worker_version` resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/worker_version) (along with the [`cloudflare_worker`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/worker) and [`cloudflare_workers_deployment`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/5.11.0/docs/resources/workers_deployment)) resources to more granularly control the lifecycle of each Worker resource.\n\n<page>\n---\ntitle: WARP client for Windows (version 2025.8.779.0) · Changelog\ndescription: WARP client for Windows (version 2025.8.779.0)\nchatbotDeprioritize: true\nsource_url:\n  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-10-07-warp-windows-ga/\n  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-10-07-warp-windows-ga/index.md\n---",
