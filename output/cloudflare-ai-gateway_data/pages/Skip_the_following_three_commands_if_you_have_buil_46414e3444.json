If you manage your website without using a framework or static site generator, or if your framework is not listed in [Framework guides](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/), you can still deploy it using this guide.\n\n## Before you continue\n\nAll of the framework guides assume you already have a fundamental understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to this [summarized Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.\n\nIf you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.\n\nRefer to the [GitHub documentation](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information.\n\n## Create a GitHub repository\n\nCreate a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, go to your newly created project directory to prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:",

      "code": "## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages\n\nTo deploy your site to Pages:\n\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.\n\n   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)\n\n2. Select **Create application**.\n\n3. Select the **Pages** tab.\n\n4. Select **Import an existing Git repository**.\n\n5. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and then select **Begin setup**.\n\n6. In the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:\n\n| Configuration option | Value |\n| - | - |\n| Production branch | `main` |\n| Build command (optional) | `exit 0` |\n| Build output directory | `<YOUR_BUILD_DIR>` |\n\nUnlike many of the framework guides, the build command and build output directory for your site are going to be completely custom. If you are not using a preset and do not need to build your site, use `exit 0` as your **Build command**. Cloudflare recommends using `exit 0` as your **Build command** to access features such as Pages Functions. The **Build output directory** is where your application's content lives.\n\nAfter configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. Your custom build command (if provided) will run, and Pages will deploy your static site.\n\nNote\n\nFor the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/).\n\nAfter you have deployed your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`. Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.\n\nGetting 404 errors on \\*.pages.dev?\n\nIf you are getting `404` errors when visiting your `*.pages.dev` domain, make sure your website has a top-level file for `index.html`. This `index.html` is what Pages will serve on your apex with no page specified.\n\n## Learn more\n\nBy completing this guide, you have successfully deployed your site to Cloudflare Pages.

Refer to the [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/) for more information.\n\nMore advanced customization of HTTP headers is available through Cloudflare Workers [serverless functions](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/).\n\nIf you have not deployed a Worker before, get started with our [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/). For the purpose of this tutorial, accomplish steps one (Sign up for a Workers account) through four (Generate a new project) before returning to this page.\n\nBefore continuing, ensure that your Cloudflare Pages project is connected to a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain).\n\n## Writing a Workers function\n\nWorkers functions are written in [JavaScript](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-javascript/). When a Worker makes a request to a Cloudflare Pages application, it will receive a response. The response a Worker receives is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed. In order to add, delete, or alter headers, clone the response and modify the headers on a new `Response` instance. Return the new response to the browser with your desired header changes.
