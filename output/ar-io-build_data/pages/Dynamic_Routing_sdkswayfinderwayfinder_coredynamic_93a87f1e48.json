  "content": "Wayfinder supports a `resolveUrl` method which generates dynamic redirect URLs to a target gateway based on the provided routing strategy. This function can be used to directly replace any hard-coded gateway URLs, and instead use Wayfinder's routing logic to select a gateway for the request.\n\nGiven an ArNS name, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.\n\nGiven a txId, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.\n\n#### Legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URLs\n\nGiven a legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.\n\nGiven an ar:// URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.",
