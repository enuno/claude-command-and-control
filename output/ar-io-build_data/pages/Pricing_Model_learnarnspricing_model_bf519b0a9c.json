  "content": "## Addressing Variable Market Conditions\n\nThe future market landscape is unpredictable, and the AR.IO Network smart contract is designed to be immutable, operating without governance or manual intervention. Using a pricing oracle to fix name prices relative to a stable currency is not viable due to the infancy of available solutions and reliance on external dependencies.\n\nTo address these challenges, ArNS is self-contained and adaptive, with name prices reflecting network activity and market conditions over time.\n\nTo achieve this, ArNS incorporates:\n\n1. A **dynamic pricing model** that adjusts fees using a \"Demand Factor\" based on ArNS purchase activity\n2. A **Returned Name Premium (RNP)** system that applies a timed, descending multiplier to registration prices for names that have recently expired or been returned to the protocol\n\nThis approach ensures that name valuations adapt to market conditions within the constraints of an immutable, maintenance-free smart contract framework.\n\nYou can view current live pricing at [ArNS.app](https://arns.ar.io/#/prices) to see these formulas in action.\n\n- **Protocol Revenue:** Accumulated ARIO tokens from name registrations, lease extensions, and under_name sales\n- **Period (P):** The time unit for DF adjustments, equivalent to one (1) day, denoted in milliseconds\n- **n:** The current period indicator\n- **Price:** The cost for permabuy or lease of a name\n- **Under_names:** Subdomain equivalents, denoted by an underscore \"\\_\" prefixing the base domain\n\n## Dynamic Pricing Model\n\nArNS employs an adaptive pricing model to balance market demand with pricing fairness for name registration within the network. This model integrates static and dynamic elements, adjusting prices based on name length and purchase options like leasing, permanent acquisition, and undername amounts.\n\n### Core Pricing Components\n\n#### Base Registration Fee (BRF)\n\nThe fundamental price for names, varying by character length, adjusted periodically.\n\n#### Genesis Registration Fee (GRF)\n\nThe starting price for name registrations varies by character length. This is superseded by Base Registration Fees as the protocol evolves.\n\n**Table: Genesis Registration Fees**\n\n| Name Length | Fee (ARIO) |\n| ----------- | ---------- |\n| 1           | 1,000,000  |\n| 2           | 200,000    |\n| 3           | 20,000     |\n| 4           | 10,000     |\n| 5           | 2,500      |\n| 6           | 1,500      |\n| 7           | 800        |\n| 8           | 500        |\n| 9           | 400        |\n| 10          | 350        |\n| 11          | 300        |\n| 12          | 250        |\n| 13-51       | 200        |\n\n#### Demand Factor (DF)\n\nA global price multiplier, reflecting namespace demand, adjusted each period based on revenue trends.\n\n- **Intent:** The Demand Factor adjusts based on protocol revenue comparison to the Revenue Moving Average (RMA)\n- **Increase DF:** When recent revenue is higher than or equal to (but non-zero) the RMA, the DF increases by 5.0%\n- **Decrease DF:** When recent revenue is less than the RMA or both are zero, the DF decreases by 1.5%\n- **Maximum DF Value:** Unbounded\n- **Minimum DF Value:** 0.5\n- **Starting Demand Factor:** 1 (initial value at network launch)\n\n#### Revenue Moving Average (RMA)\n\nThe average of protocol revenue from the past seven (7) periods.\n\n#### Adjusted Registration Fee (ARF)\n\n- **Lease Registration Price:**\n\n- **Lease Extension/Renewal Price:**\n\n- **Grace period:** Two (2) weeks\n\n#### Permanent Purchases\n\n- **Permabuy Price:**\n\n- **Lease to Permabuy Price:** Same as above\n\n- **Initial Allocation:** 10 `under_names` are included with each name registration\n- **For Leases:**\n\n#### Primary Name Fee\n\nSet or change primary name: The fee is equal to the associated fee for a single `under_name` purchase of a 51-character name of equivalent purchase type to the new primary name, regardless of the new primary name's length.\n\n### Step Pricing Mechanics\n\n- Synchronizes BRF (Base Rate Factor) with ARF (Adjusted Rate Factor) after seven (7) consecutive periods at the minimum DF value\n- Resets DF to 1 following a step pricing adjustment\n\n## Returned Name Premiums (RNP)\n\nArNS applies a **Returned Name Premium (RNP)** to names that re-enter the market after expiration or permanent return. This premium starts at a maximum value and decreases linearly over a predefined window, ensuring fair and transparent pricing for re-registered names.\n\nThe premium starts at its maximum and decreases linearly until the name is purchased. If the name is not purchased before the premium window closes, it reverts to standard pricing and is no longer classified as \"recently returned.\"\n\n- **Duration:** Fourteen (14) periods\n\n#### Returned Name Premium Formula\n\nThe premium multiplier follows a linearly declining function:\n\n- **RNP:** The Returned Name Premium multiplier applied to the purchased name price\n- **t:** Amount of time (or time-intervals) elapsed since the start of the return window\n\n#### RNP Registration Price\n\n#### Permanent Name Return Proceeds Split\n\n- **50%** goes to the returning name owner\n- **50%** goes to the protocol balance\n\nThe RNP multiplier is applied to the registration price of both permanently purchased and leased names.\n\n## Gateway Operator ArNS Discount\n\nGateway operators who demonstrate consistent, healthy participation in the network are eligible for a **20% discount** on certain ArNS interactions.\n\n### Qualification Requirements\n\nTo qualify for the discount:\n\n- The gateway must maintain a \"Gateway Performance Ratio Weight\" (GPRW) of **0.9 or higher**\n- The gateway must have a \"Tenure Weight\" (TW) of **1.0 or greater**\n- A gateway marked as \"Leaving\" shall not be eligible for this discount\n\n### Eligible Discounted Interactions\n\n- Purchasing a name\n- Extending a lease\n- Upgrading a lease to permabuy\n- Increasing undernames capacity\n\nCongratulations!
