  "content": "An important feature of the ArDrive CLI is the `--dry-run` flag. On each command that would write an ArFS entity, there is the option to run it as a \"dry run\". This will run all of the steps and print the outputs of a regular ArFS write, but will skip sending the actual transaction:\n\nThis can be very useful for gathering price estimations or to confirm that you've copy-pasted your entity IDs correctly before committing to an upload.",
