  "content": "Configure your AR.IO Gateway to serve custom content from the apex domain instead of the default Arweave network information. This allows you to customize your gateway's root domain with useful information, project details, or any content you wish to share.\n\nPrior to gateway Release 28, the apex domain of a gateway would only display information about the Arweave network. Release 28 introduced two new environment variables that allow a gateway to serve custom content from the apex domain:\n\n- `APEX_TX_ID`: Set to serve content from a specific transaction ID\n- `APEX_ARNS_NAME`: Set to serve content from an ArNS name\n\nThese variables enable gateway operators to customize their gateway's apex domain with useful information, details about the operator or associated projects, or any other content they wish to share.\n\n### Choose Your Content Source\n\nDecide how you want to serve your content:\n\n**Option 1: Direct Transaction ID**\n\n- Upload your content to Arweave\n- Use the transaction ID directly\n\n**Option 2: ArNS Name (Recommended)**\n\n- Upload your content to Arweave\n- Assign your content's transaction ID to an ArNS name\n- Use the ArNS name for easier management\n\n### Upload Your Content\n\nUpload your dApp, website, or other content to Arweave using your preferred method:\n\n- **ArDrive** - For simple file uploads\n- **Turbo** - For application bundles\n- **Direct upload** - For advanced users\n\n### Configure Environment Variable\n\nAdd one of these variables to your `.env` file:",
