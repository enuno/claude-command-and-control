Use the quick lookup table below for fast answers, or browse the detailed sections for in-depth guidance.\n\nBelow is a quick summary of what you should check when troubleshooting your gateway. Find more detailed information in the sections below.\n\n| Issue                                                        | What to Check                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| My release number is wrong                                   | Pull the latest github updates and make sure you are on the `main` branch |\n| Gateway appears offline on Viewblock or https://gateways.ar.io        | Probably fine, but verify that your gateway is still running.             |\n| '/ar-io/observer/reports/current' just says \"report pending\" | Normal behavior, wait for the report to complete.                         |\n| Observer error \"Cannot read properties of undefined\"         | Normal behavior, Observer is checking for data not implemented yet.       |\n| Observing my gateway shows failures                          | Check `AR_IO_WALLET` and `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` settings.                       |\n| Updated .env settings not reflected on gateway               | Rebuild your gateway after editing .env file.                             |\n| Out of disk space error                                      | Check for inode exhaustion and delete files if necessary.                 |\n| Can't load ArNS names                                        | Check `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` setting in .env file, and DNS records.             |\n| \"Your connection is not private\" error                       | Generate or renew SSL certificates.                                       |\n| 404/Nginx error when accessing domain                        | Check Nginx settings and restart Nginx if necessary.                      |\n| 502 error from Nginx                                         | Check for errors in your gateway.                                         |\n| Trouble generating SSL certificates                          | Ensure TXT records have propagated and follow certbot instructions.       |\n\n## General Troubleshooting\n\n### My Gateway Seems to be Running but...\n\nIf your release number when you go to `/ar-io/info` is lower than the current release, you simply need to upgrade your gateway in order to reach the latest release.\n\nIf your release number includes the suffix \"-pre\" it means you are running your gateway from the development branch of the github repository, instead of the main branch. The development branch is used for staging work that the engineering team is in the middle of. Because of this, it can be much less stable than the main branch used for production and can cause significant issues.\n\nEnsure that you are running the latest release, from the main branch, by running the below commands in your terminal:\n\nIf this doesn't resolve the issue, you can also try a more extreme method of clearing out the incorrect docker images:\n\nViewblock and https://gateways.ar.io use a very simple ping method for determining if a gateway is \"up\". There are plenty of reasons why this ping may fail while the gateway is running perfectly, so showing as down is not cause for concern. Just verify that your gateway is still running, and wait. Your gateway will show as up again soon.\n\nThis is normal. Your Observer is working to generate a report and that report will be displayed once it is complete.\n\nThis is not an issue with your observer. The short explanation is that your Observer is looking for tasks assigned to it by the AR.IO network contract, but there isnt anything there. You can safely ignore this error message.\n\nWhen observing a gateway, there are two main pass/fail tests. \"Ownership\" and \"ArNS Assessment\"\n\n- Ownership: This tests to see if the value set in your gateway `AR_IO_WALLET` value (in .env) matches the wallet used to join the AR.IO Network. If they don't match, update the value in your .env file and restart your gateway.\n\n- ArNS Assessment: This tests to see if a gateway is able to resolve ArNS names correctly. The first thing you should check is if you have the `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` value set in your .env file. If not, set the value and restart your gateway. If this value is set, check to make sure you have current DNS records and SSL certificates for wildcard subdomains on your gateway.\n\nOnce you edit your .env file, you need to \"rebuild\" your gateway for the changes to take effect. As of release 3, every time you start your gateway with `docker-compose` it is automatically rebuilt. So all you need to do is shut your gateway down and restart it.\n\nThe most likely cause of this is inode exhaustion. Test this by running the command:\n\nIf one of the lines in the output says 100%, you have run out of inodes and so your filesystem is not capable of creating new files, even if you have available space. The solution is to delete files from your `data` folder in order to free up inodes.\n\nThis was a common issue prior to release #3, when Redis caching was introduced to reduce the number of small files created. If you are using an older version of the gateway, consider upgrading to mitigate the risk of inode exhaustion.\n\nThe first thing you should check if your gateway is not resolving ArNS names is that you have `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` set in your .env file. If not, set it to your domain name used for the gateway. For example, `ARNS_ROOT_HOST=arweave.dev`.\n\nOnce this value is set, restart your gateway for the changes to take effect.\n\nIf that doesn't resolve the issue, check your dns records. You need to have a wildcard subdomain ( \\*. ) set with your domain registrar so that ArNS names will actually point at your gateway. You can set this record, and generate an SSL certificate for it, in the same way you set the records for your primary domain.\n\nThis error message means that your SSL certificates have expired. You need to renew your certificates by running the same certbot command you used when you initially started your gateway:\n\nCertbot SSL certificates expire after 90 days, and you will need to rerun this command to renew every time. If you provide an email address, you will receive an email letting you know when it is time to renew.\n\nIf you navigate to your domain and see a 404 error from Nginx (the reverse proxy server used in the setup guide) it means that your domain is correctly pointed at the machine running your gateway, but you have not properly configured your Nginx settings (or your gateway is not running).\n\nThe [Set up Networking](./linux-setup.md#set-up-networking) section of the setup guide has detailed instructions on configuring your Nginx server. If all else fails, try restarting Nginx, that usually clears any issues with the server clinging to old configurations.\n\nA 502 error from Nginx means that Nginx is working correctly, but it is receiving an error from your gateway when it tries to forward traffic.\n\nWhen using the manual certbot command provided in the setup guide:\n\nYou need to be sure that you are waiting after creating your TXT records for them to completely propagate. You can check propagation using a tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org).\n\nIf you continue to have issues, you can check the [official certbot instructions guide](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions).\n\n- Visit your gateway in a browser and see if your SSL certs are expired. This is the most common issue causing sudden stops in proper operation.\n\n- Try restarting nginx, it sometimes has trouble looking at the new certs without a restart.\n\n- Make sure `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` is properly set in your `.env` file. Updating this requires restarting your gateway.\n- Make sure you have a DNS record set for `*.`. Since ArNS names are served as subdomains, you need to make sure all subdomains are pointed at your gateway.\n- If your gateway is attempting to resolve the name, but times out, it's most likely a CU issue.\n\n- AR.IO gateways are very robust, they can handle temporary errors gracefully and not affect normal operation. You should only be concerned if the error is consistent or it is causing your gateway to not function properly.\n\n- Observers generate and submit their reports at specific times throughout the epoch. This is to ensure a healthy network throughout the entire epoch, not just at the start.\n- Your observer wallet must match the observer wallet associated with your gateway in the AR.IO contract. You can check this by navigating to your gateway in https://gateways.ar.io.\n\n- This happens when a request to a CU fails, and your gateway receives an html failure message instead of the expected JSON response. This will normally clear up on its own after congestion on that CU dies down, but if it is persistent try switching to a different CU.\n\n- This is normal. It means you have reached the current Arweave block and need to wait for more before you can index them.\n\n- This is normal. If a gateway fails to resolve an arns name within 3 seconds, it will fall back to a trusted gateway (arweave.net by default) to help resolve the name.\n\n- There are many reasons a gateway could fail an epoch. Following these steps is usually enough to identify and correct the issue:\n  - Try to visit your gateway in a browser and see if your SSL certs are bad\n  - Try to resolve an ArNS name on your gateway. If it fails to resolve, check the console and your gateway logs for errors\n  - Look at the observation reports that failed your gateway, they will list the reason for failure\n\n## Troubleshooting Failed Epochs\n\nThe ARIO Network provides several tools to help troubleshoot problems with a gateway. The most powerful among these is the [Observer](/learn/oip).\n\nThe Observer, which is a component of every gateway joined to the ARIO Network, checks all gateways in the network to ensure that they are functioning properly, and returning the correct data. The Observer then creates a report of the results of these checks, including the reasons why a gateway might have failed the checks.\n\nIf a gateway fails the checks from more than half of the prescribed observers, the gateway is marked as failed for the epoch, and does not receive any rewards for that epoch.\n\nThe first step in troubleshooting a failed gateway is always to attempt to resolve data on that gateway in a browser, but if that does not make the issue clear, the Observer report can be used to diagnose the problem.\n\n### Manual Observation\n\nManual observations may be run on a gateway at any time buy using the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io). This allows operators (or anyone with an interest in the gateway's performance) to check the gateway's performance at any time. To run a manual observation:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io)\n2. Select the gateway you are interested in from the list of gateways\n3. Click on the \"Observe\" button in the top right corner of the page.\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/0G52dTWe65abQ6qDGvI99ERAaGU7DHR9srimJXnYRGA)\n\n4. Click on the \"Run Observation\" button in the bottom right corner of the page.\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/A_B_58rufQ0Pj4ri0AKuC0DJn61u5ayO5ONWpkMerQw)\n\nTwo randomly selected ArNS names will be entered automatically in the \"ArNS names\" field to the left of the \"Run Observation\" button. These can be changed, or additional ArNS names can be added to the list before running the observation.\n\nThe Manual observation will run the same checks as the observer, and will display the results on the right side of the page.\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/vgRXfbx4fa47qGDpjndq128VCHl1wajKaq464KeA0Qg)\n\n### Accessing the Observer Report\n\nThe simplest way to access an observer report is via the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io), following the steps below:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io)\n2. Select the gateway you are interested in from the list of gateways\n3. In the Observation window, select the epoch you are interested in. This will display a list of the observers that failed the gateway for that epoch.\n4. Click on the \"View Report\" button to the right any observer on that list. This will display the entire report that observer generated.\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/ynbxYU_8xLRaU1D6a_LMoUq00roWwsMKgr-xrsDE0Sk)\n\n5. Locate the gateway you are interested in in the report, and click on that row. This will display the report for that gateway.\n\n### Understanding the Observer Report\n\nThe observer report will display a list of checked ArNS names, and a reason if the gateway failed to return the correct data for that name. There are several reasons why a gateway might fail to return the correct data for an ArNS name. Below is a list of the most common reasons, and how to resolve them.\n\n#### Timeout awaiting 'socket', or Timeout awaiting 'connect'\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/_GupbMa-EW_wiCD201MuOkDQrLT0MXTfxDXhLSDmyh4)\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/0WkzxdyN-9hJfv0pSiTs0Ozg_wqFvE3-OWlgzYPimtU)\n\nThis failure means that the observer was unable to connect to the gateway when it tried to check the ArNS name. There are lots of reasons why this might happen, many of them unrelated to the gateway itself. If an observer report has a small number of these failures, among a larger number of successful checks, it is unlikely to be an issue with the gateway.\n\nIf this failure occurs persistently for a large number, or all ArNS names checked, it likely means that the observer is having trouble connecting to the gateway at all. You can verify this by:\n\n- Attempting to connect to the gateway in a browser\n- Running manual observations on the gateway using the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io)\n- Using tools like `curl` or `ping` to check the gateway's connectivity\n\nIf these methods consistently fail to connect to the gateway, it is likely that the gateway is not properly configured or powered on. If this is the case:\n\n- Check Docker and the gateway's logs to see if the gateway is on.\n- Ensure that the SSL certificates are valid for the gateway's domain.\n- Check DNS records for the gateway's domain, misconfigured or conflicting DNS records can cause connectivity issues.\n\nSome gateway operators who run their gateways on their personal home networks have also reported issues with their ISP blocking, throttling, or otherwise delaying traffic to a gateway. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be worth checking with your ISP to see if they are blocking or throttling traffic to the gateway.\n\nUsing [Grafana](/build/extensions/grafana) can also provide a visual representation of the gateway's ArNS resolution times. If this is consistently high (above 10 seconds), it is likely that the gateway is not properly configured to resolve ArNS names. Ensure that the gateway is operating on the latest Release.\n\n#### Cert has expired\n\nThis failure means that the gateway's SSL certificate has expired. Obtaining a new SSL certificate and updating the gateway's reverse proxy (nginx, etc) configuration to use the new certificate is the only solution to this issue.\n\n#### dataHashDigest mismatch\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/xXe0bHne--0JJv-HRf5HT9R1V1UbzaOh2AxvAdQZhjg)\n\nThis failure means that the gateway did respond to a resolution request, but the data it returned did not match the data that was expected. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:\n\n- Cached data was returned by the gateway that doesnt match the most current data on the network.\n- The gateway is configured to operate on testnet or devnet. Gateways joined to the ARIO Network MUST operate on mainnet in order to pass observation checks.\n- The gateway is intentionally returning fraudulent data.\n\nA gateway will not return fraudulent data unless that operator intentionally rewrote the gateway's code to do so, and a major purpose of the Observation and Incentive Protocol is to catch and prevent this behavior. A gateway may return mistaken data on occasion, usually due to a cache mismatch between the gateway and the observer's authority (usually arweavae.net). This is a relatively rare occurrence, and should only be considered an issue if it occurs persistently. If most or all of the ArNS names checked are failing for this reason, it is likely that the gateway is not operating on mainnet.\n\n#### Response code 502 (Bad Gateway)\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/NBQsYUKP6IZt_rYg77QXgzwUUPvimFGXCQqtesbW1_I)\n\nThis failure means that the observer was able to connect to the gateway's network, but the reverse proxy returned a 502 error. This is almost always a reverse proxy issue. Ensure that the gateway's reverse proxy is running, and that it is configured to forward requests to the gateway.\n\nTesting the validity of the reverse proxy's configuration file (`sudo nginx -t` on Nginx) may provide more information about the issue, and restarting the reverse proxy (`sudo nginx -s reload`) often resolves the issue if there are no problems with the configuration file.\n\nIt is also possible that the gateway itself is not running at all. Check Docker and the gateway's logs to see if the gateway is on.\n\n#### Response code 503 (Service Unavailable)\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/7eFKSm-cs81-aJ_H4xkolR2nSlxl5tYWXJdFTei8Dbs)\n\nThis failure means that the observer was able to connect to the gateway's network, but the reverse proxy was unable to forward the request to the gateway. It differs from the 502 error in that the reverse proxy is likely able to see that the gateway is running, but is unable to communicate with it. This is often a temporary issue, caused by the gateway not being able to handle a heavy load of requests, or the gateway being in the process of restarting. If this failure occurs once or twice in a report, it is likely a temporary issue and should not be considered an issue with the gateway. However, when this failure occurs persistently, particularly for every ArNS name checked on the report, it is likely that the gateway may have crashed.\n\nManually restarting the gateway can likely resolve the issue.\n\n#### connect EHOSTUNREACH\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/O-uG-yGm5bNxjw2ADH_yBjOcGo-ZEiFym8GeFZZNueY)\n\nThis failure means that the observer was unable to connect to the gateway at all. The connection was either refused, or the gateway was not able to find a target based on the domain name's DNS records.\n\nThis is almost always an issue with DNS records or local network configuration. Ensure that the gateway domain has correct DNS records, and that the local network is set up to allow connections. Checking logs from the local network's reverse proxy (nginx, etc) may provide more information about the issue.\n\n#### getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/WJDwW0NM29uKC-9puvhXK_n75vgFXLpa6VKFVMhRsLQ)\n\nThis is another DNS related issue. Likely, the gateway does not have a valid DNS record either for the top level domain or the required wildcard subdomain. Having this failure occur once or twice in a report could mean that the DNS server being used by the observer is having temporary issues and should not be considered an issue with the gateway. However, when this failure occurs persistently, particularly for every ArNS name checked on the report, it is likely that the gateway's DNS records are not set, or are misconfigured.\n\n#### Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: \\. is not in the cert's altnames: DNS:\\\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/HfOfpAYm811dWFPNQC7bANEvjGVK4ch3kO7K7qMN9qs)\n\nThis failure means that the observer's SSL certificate does not match the gateway's domain name. This is almost always an issue with the gateway's SSL certificate. This most likely occurred because the gateway's operator did not update the gateway's SSL certificate when the gateway's domain name was changed. Obtaining a new SSL certificate and updating the gateway's reverse proxy configuration to use the new certificate is the only solution to this issue.\n\n#### write EPROTO \\:error:\\:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv1 unrecognized name:\\:SSL alert number 112\n\n![Diagram](https://arweave.net/Hbip_ZmqmFN8-uXijw1aylyYp1YllwgyZTNAcsPCxSg)\n\nThis failure almost always means that the gateway operator did not properly obtain SSL certificates for the gateway's wildcard subdomain. Obtaining a new SSL certificate and updating the gateway's reverse proxy configuration to use the new certificate is the only solution to this issue.\n\n- Gateway protocol rewards are calculated as 0.1% of the protocol balance (0.05% after August 2025) split between all gateways in the network. A change in the protocol balance or the number of gateways in the network between epochs will result in the reward for an individual gateway changing.\n\n- The Observer rewards are separate from protocol rewards, and if your gateway is selected as an observer for an epoch, assuming it performs its duties well, it will receive additional rewards\n\nThe observer selection process uses a weighted random selection method that considers multiple factors beyond just stake:\n\n- **Stake Weight (SW)**: Ratio of your total staked ARIO tokens (including delegated stake) to the network minimum\n- **Tenure Weight (TW)**: How long your gateway has been part of the network (capped at 4 after 2 years)\n- **Gateway Performance Ratio Weight (GPRW)**: Ratio of epochs where you correctly resolved names vs total participation\n- **Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)**: Ratio of epochs where you successfully submitted reports vs total observer periods\n\nA composite weight (CW) is calculated as: CW = SW × TW × GPRW × OPRW\n\nUp to 50 gateways are chosen as observers per epoch. If there are more than 50 gateways, selection is randomized based on these normalized weights. Even with a high stake, other factors like performance and tenure affect your chances of being selected.\n\n- There is a 90 day locking period when withdrawing stake, either from delegated stake or operator stake on your gateway. This locking period can be skipped, for a fee. The fee starts at 50% of the withdrawal amount, and goes down over time. If you selected instant withdrawal, you paid the fee to skip the locking period.\n\n- The minimum operator stake for gateways (10,000 ARIO) cannot be instantly withdrawn, it is subject to the full 90 day locking period, and withdrawal can only be started by removing your gateway from the network.\n\n- If possible, leave your original server running while you prepare the new one\n- Set up the new server following the same steps you used to set up the original server\n  - This includes setting up SSL certificates for the new server\n- You must use the same gateway wallet when setting up the new server\n- The observer wallet may be changed at any point, but requires extra steps. It is recommended you use the original observer wallet as well\n- Once the new server is set up, change your DNS A records to point at the new server\n- After your DNS records are set and you have verified your gateway is operating correctly, shut down the original server\n- No changes need to be made in the network contract or on https://gateways.ar.io\n\n- Yes\n- Configure your new domain to point at your gateway, including setting up SSL certificates\n- Update your NGINX (or other reverse proxy) server to recognize the new domain. This usually requires a restart of NGINX\n- Update the `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` variable in your `.env` and restart the gateway\n- Using https://gateways.ar.io, update your gateway settings to change the FQDN in the contract\n- Your gateway is now using the new domain name for normal operation.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the troubleshooting process, please seek assistance from the [AR.IO community](https://discord.com/invite/HGG52EtTc2).\n\n**Ready to get back to building?** Once your gateway is running smoothly, check out [Manage your Gateway](/build/run-a-gateway/manage) for guides on optimization, monitoring, and more.",
