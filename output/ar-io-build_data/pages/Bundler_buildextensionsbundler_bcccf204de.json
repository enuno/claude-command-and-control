  "content": "A [Turbo ANS-104](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service/) data item bundler can be run alongside an AR.IO gateway. This allows gateways the ability to accept data items to be submitted to the Arweave blockweave.\n\nThe bundler service can be easily run inside Docker in the same way that the gateway is. It utilizes a separate docker compose file for configuration and deployment, which also allows for the use of a separate file for environmental variables specific to the bundler service. Additionally, the separation allows operators to spin their bundler service up or down at any time without affecting their core gateway service. Despite the use of separate docker compose files, the bundler service shares a docker network with the AR.IO gateway, and so is able to directly interact with the gateway service and data.\n\nFor more information on ANS-104 Bundles, see the [ANS-104 Bundles](/learn/ans-104-bundles) page.\n\n**NOTE**: The bundler service relies on GraphQL indexing of recently bundled\n  and uploaded data to manage its pipeline operations. The AR.IO gateway should\n  have its indexes synced up to Arweave's current block height before starting\n  the bundler's service stack.\n\n### Configure Environmental Variables\n\nEnvironmental variables must be provided for the bundler to function and integrate properly with an existing AR.IO gateway. The gateway repository provides a `.env.bundler.example` file that can be renamed to `.env.bundler` and used as a starting point. It contains the following:\n\n```bash\nBUNDLER_ARWEAVE_WALLET='Stringified JWK wallet. e.g: '{ \"n\": \"...\", ... }'\nBUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS='Address for above wallet'\n\nAPP_NAME='AR.IO bundler service'",
