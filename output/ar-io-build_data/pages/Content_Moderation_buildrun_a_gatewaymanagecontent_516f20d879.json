  "content": "Arweave is a network designed for permanent storage of data. It is a practical impossibility for data to be wholly removed from the network once it has been uploaded.\n\nThe AR.IO Network has adopted Arweave's voluntary content moderation model, whereby every participant of the network has the autonomy to decide which content they want to (or can legally) store, serve, and see. Each gateway operating on the network has the right and ability to blocklist any content, ArNS name, or address that is deemed in violation of its content policies or is non-compliant with local regulations.\n\nGateway operators may set content to be blocked by their gateway by submitting a `PUT` request to their gateway defining the content to be blocked. This requires that the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environmental variable to be set in order to authenticate the moderation request.\n\nThe simplest method for submitting moderation requests to a gateway is to use `curl` in a terminal.\n\n### Set Up Admin API Key\n\nConfigure your admin API key in your `.env` file:",
