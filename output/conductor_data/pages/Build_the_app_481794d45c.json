You can copy or symlink them depending on your needs.\n\nHere's the [setup script we use for Conductor](https://gist.github.com/cbh123/10b4e522252eb9d900872921fbeb736d) and a walkthrough of how it works: <video />\n\nFor long-running processes that should run in the background while you develop, add a [run script](/core/scripts#run-script).\n\nFor more details about how setup scripts work, see [Scripts](/core/scripts).",
