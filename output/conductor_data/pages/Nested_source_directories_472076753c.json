This means no more need to add `.conductor` to gitignore or exclude it from your build tools, and helps prevent agents from getting confused about where to edit files.\n\nFor repos added to Conductor before 0.25.0 (December 3, 2025), workspaces are still stored in the `.conductor` folder inside your repository root. Some dev tools have trouble with nested source directories.\n\nTo migrate to the new system:\n\n1. Find the workspace name in the sidebar\n2. Next to the name, click on the \"Repository details\" button\n3. Click \"Remove\". (Warning: This will delete all your workspaces and chats.)\n4. Add the repository again\n\nIf you run into any issues, please reach out to us at [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build).",
