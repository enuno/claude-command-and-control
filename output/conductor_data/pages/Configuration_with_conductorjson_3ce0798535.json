  "content": "Source: https://docs.conductor.build/core/conductor-json\n\nConductor uses the `conductor.json` file to configure [scripts](./scripts).\n\n## Shared configuration\n\nThe best way to use `conductor.json` is to create it in the root directory of your workspace and then check it into git.\n\nThis will let you version your configuration along with your code, and let new developers get started quickly using Conductor in your repo.\n\n## Local configuration\n\nAlternatively, you can create the `conductor.json` file in your repo root directory. This configuration will apply across all your workspaces.\n\nYou can get to the repo root directory by clicking the repository name in the sidebar and then clicking the Open button.\n\nConductor looks for a `conductor.json` file in three places:\n\n1. **The root of your workspace.** In a workspace `~/my-repo/.conductor/tokyo`, Conductor will look for `~/my-repo/.conductor/tokyo/conductor.json`.\n2. **The root of the default branch on remote.** Typically this will be `origin/main`.\n3. **The root of your repository.** In a repository `~/my-repo`, Conductor will look for `~/my-repo/conductor.json`.",
