After the script runs, it provides a success message and instructions for accessing Dokploy.\n\nThis structured format clearly lays out the prerequisites, steps, and post-installation information, making it user-friendly and accessible for those performing manual installations.\n\n## Customize install\n\n#### Customize swarm advertise address\n\nThe --advertise-addr parameter in the docker swarm init command specifies the IP address or interface that the Docker Swarm manager node should advertise to other nodes in the Swarm. This address is used by other nodes to communicate with the manager.\n\nBy default, this script uses the external IP address of the server, obtained using the `curl -s ifconfig.me` command. However, you might need to customize this address based on your network configuration, especially if your server has multiple network interfaces or if you're setting up Swarm in a private network.\n\nTo customize the --advertise-addr parameter, replace the line: `advertise_addr=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)` with your desired IP address or interface, for example:\n`advertise_addr=\"192.168.1.100\"`\n\n:warning: This IP address should be accessible to all nodes that will join the Swarm.\n\n## Existing Docker swarm\n\nIf you already have a Docker swarm running on your server and you want to use dokploy, you can use the following command to join it:",
