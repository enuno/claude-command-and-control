Go to `https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/new` .\n2. Set Label: eg. `Dokploy-Bitbucket-App`. you can choose any name that you want.\n3. In permissions make sure to select `Account: Read`, `Workspace membership: Read`, `Projects: Read`\n   , `Repositories: Read` `Pull requests: Read` and `Webhooks: Read and write`.\n4. Click on `Create`.\n5. Copy the `App Password` and paste it in Dokploy `Bitbucket` Modal section.\n6. Set your `Bitbucket Username`.\n7. (Optional) If you want to use Workspaces, go to `https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/`, eg. If you have\n   `dokploy-workspace` copy and paste it in Workspace Name, please make sure to use the slugified name, if you use names like Dokploy Workspace in this field can cause issues.\n8. Click on `Configure Bitbucket`.\n9. If everything is correct, you can update enter to the Update Icon, and click on `Test Connection` to make sure everything is working.\n10. Now you can use the repositories from your Gitlab Account in `Applications` or `Docker Compose` services.\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  Dokploy doesn't support Bitbucket Automatic deployments on each push you make to your repository.\n</Callout>\n\n## Setup Automatic Deployments\n\nYou can configure automatic deployments in Dokploy for the Following Services:\n\n1. **Applications**\n2. **Docker Compose**\n\nThe steps are the same for both services.\n\n1. Go to either `Applications` or `Docker Compose` and go to `Deployments` Tab.\n2. Copy the `Webhook URL`.\n3. Go to your Bitbucket Account and select the repository.\n4. In the left menu, select `Repository Settings` and then `Webhooks`.\n5. Click on `Add Webhook`.\n6. Set any `Title` and the `URL` to the one you copied in the previous step.\n7. In the Trigger section, select `Push Events`.\n8. Click on `Add Webhook`.\n9. Now you have automatic deployments enabled for the selected repository.\n\n## Clarification on Automatic Deployments\n\nBy default, Dokploy will automatically deploy your application on the Branch you have selected.\n\neg. Let's suppose you have a `application` in this way:\n\nRepository: `my-app`\nBranch: `feature`\n\nIf you try to make a push on another branch eg. `main`, Dokploy will not automatically deploy your application, because\nyour application have selected `feature` as the Branch.\n\n<Callout>\n  In the case you want to have multiple applications in the same repository, eg. (development, staging, production), you can create 3 `Applications` in Dokploy\n  and select the branch in each of them.\n\nThis is very usefull if you want to have multiple environments for the same application.\n</Callout>",
