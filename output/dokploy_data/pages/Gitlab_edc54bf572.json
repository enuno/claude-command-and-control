Go to `https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications` and click on ` Add New Application`.\n2. Set Application Name: eg. `Dokploy-Gitlab-App`. choose any name that you want.\n3. Redirect URI: Copy the `Redirect URI` from Dokploy. eg. `https://dokploy.com/api/providers/gitlab/callback`.\n4. Select Permissions: `api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`.\n5. Click on `Save Application`.\n6. Copy the `Application ID` and `Secret` from Gitlab and paste it in Dokploy `Gitlab` Modal section.\n7. (Optional) If you want to use Groups, go to `https://gitlab.com/dashboard/groups` enter the group name you\n   want to connect, and look at the URL in the address bar, it will be something like this\n   `https://gitlab.com/dokploy-panel/frontend` you can use Nested Groups and SubGroups and copy the `dokploy-panel/frontend` from Gitlab and paste\n   it in Dokploy `Gitlab` Modal section.\n8. Click on `Continue`.\n9. Go Back to Dokploy and click on `Install` button.\n10. Click on `Authorize`.\n11. You will be redirected to the `Git` section of Dokploy.\n12. Now you can use the repositories from your Gitlab Account in `Applications` or `Docker Compose` services.\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  Dokploy doesn't support Gitlab Automatic deployments on each push you make to your repository.\n</Callout>\n\n## Setup Automatic Deployments\n\nYou can configure automatic deployments in Dokploy for the Following Services:\n\n1. **Applications**\n2. **Docker Compose**\n\nThe steps are the same for both services.\n\n1. Go to either `Applications` or `Docker Compose` and go to `Deployments` Tab.\n2. Copy the `Webhook URL`.\n3. Go to your Gitlab Account and select the repository.\n4. In the left menu, select `Settings` and then `Webhooks`.\n5. Click on `Add Webhook`.\n6. Set the `URL` to the one you copied in the previous step.\n7. In the Trigger section, select `Push Events`.\n8. Click on `Add Webhook`.\n9. Click on `Save`.\n10. Now you have automatic deployments enabled for the selected repository.\n\n## Clarification on Automatic Deployments\n\nBy default, Dokploy will automatically deploy your application on the Branch you have selected.\n\neg. Let's suppose you have a `application` in this way:\n\nRepository: `my-app`\nBranch: `feature`\n\nIf you try to make a push on another branch eg. `main`, Dokploy will not automatically deploy your application, because\nyour application have selected `feature` as the Branch.\n\n<Callout>\n  In the case you want to have multiple applications in the same repository, eg. (development, staging, production), you can create 3 `Applications` in Dokploy\n  and select the branch in each of them.\n\nThis is very usefull if you want to have multiple environments for the same application.\n</Callout>",
