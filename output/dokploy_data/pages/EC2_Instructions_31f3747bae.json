An AWS account\n2. A domain that is managed by AWS Route53\n\n## 1. Create an SSH Key\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  If you already have an SSH Key you can skip this step and simply go to settings -> SSH Keys and add the SSH Key you have stored on your machine\n</Callout>\n\nNavigate to Dokploy Settings -> SSH Keys and add a new key\n\nYou will receive a public key and a private key. Copy the public key and save it.\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/ssh-keys.png\" alt=\"SSH Keys\" width={1000} height={600} className=\"rounded-lg\" />\n\n## 2. Create an EC2 Instance\n\nLogin to your AWS account, navigate to EC2 and click on Launch Instance.\n\nWe will then be prompted to select an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and we will select the Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS AMI.\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/deployment/oracle/oracle-shape.png\" alt=\"EC2 AMI\" width={1000} height={600} className=\"rounded-lg\" />\n\nSelect the instance type you want to use. For this guide we will use the `t2.micro` instance type which is free tier eligible.\n\nNow we need to add the SSH Key we created in step 1 to the EC2 instance.\n\nClick on Security Group and then add a new key pair.\n\nAdd the name of your SSH Key and paste the public key you copied in step 1.\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/hostinger-add-sshkey.png\" alt=\"Add SSH Key\" width={1000} height={600} className=\"rounded-lg\" />\n\nYou will have to create a security group that allows SSH (port 22) access from your IP address. and open all HTTP and HTTPS ports for ingress and egress traffic (Port 80 and 443).\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  Opening port 22 to the internet is a security risk. It is recommended to use a bastion host or a VPN to access your EC2 instance securely.\n</Callout>\n\nNow click on Launch Instance and wait for the instance to be created.\n\n## 3. Add the Server to Dokploy\n\nNow that we have the EC2 instance running, we can add it to Dokploy.\n\nNavigate to Dokploy -> Settings -> Servers and click on Add Server and copy the server IP Address.\n\n## 4. Setup the Server\n\nNavigate to Dokploy -> Settings -> Servers -> Setup Server and follow the instructions.\n\n## 5. Deploy your application\n\nNow that the server is setup, you can deploy your application to the server.",
