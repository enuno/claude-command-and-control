  "content": "Preview deployments are a powerful feature specifically designed for applications with GitHub integration. This feature is disabled by default but can be easily enabled to enhance your development workflow.\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/preview-deployments.png\" width={800} height={630} alt=\"Preview deployments\" className=\"rounded-lg\" />\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  We recommend not using preview deployments for public repositories, since external people can execute builds and deployments in your server.\n</Callout>\n\nBy default, Dokploy generates dynamic domains using traefik.me domains, which are free and require no additional configuration. The default port is 3000, but you can adjust this based on your application's requirements. You can also limit the number of  preview deployments per application (default is 3).\n\nIf you prefer using a custom domain, you can configure it like this:\n\nDokploy will generate domains following this pattern:\n\nTo make this work, you need to point your wildcard DNS record (\\*) to your server's IP address.\n\nOnce enabled, preview deployments are automatically created whenever a pull request is opened against your target branch (configured in your provider settings).\n\n* If your provider is configured to use the `main` branch\n* And you create a pull request from `feature/new-feature` to `main`\n* A preview deployment will be automatically created for the `feature/new-feature` branch\n\nNote: Pull requests to branches other than your configured target branch will not trigger preview deployments.\n\nIf you only want pull requests with a specific label to create preview deployments, you can specify one or multiple in the preview settings.\nDokploy will check that at least one of the labels is present on the pull request. If you leave the settings field empty, Dokploy will create\npreview deployments for all pull requests, regardless of labels.\n\n### Monitoring Deployments\n\nWhen you open a pull request, you can monitor the deployment progress in the preview deployments section:\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/preview-deploy.png\" width={800} height={630} alt=\"Preview deployments build\" className=\"rounded-lg\" />\n\nIn this section, you can:\n\n* View the deployment status\n* Access the preview URL once deployed\n* Check build and deployment logs\n* Monitor deployment updates\n* Update domain configuration\n\n### Automatic Updates\n\nThe preview deployment will automatically:\n\n* Update with each new commit to the pull request\n* Create a new build and deployment\n* Clean up when the pull request is closed or merged\n\nThis continuous preview system allows teams to review and test changes in isolation before merging to production.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  If you have security or redirects created in your application, it will inherit the same configuration for the preview deployment.\n</Callout>",
