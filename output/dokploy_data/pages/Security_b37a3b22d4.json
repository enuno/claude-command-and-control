Our security checks ensure your server follows best practices for a secure deployment environment.\n\n## Security Recommendations\n\n* Currently supports Ubuntu/Debian OS (Experimental)\n* Regular system updates recommended\n\n### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)\n\nUFW is an essential security component that manages incoming and outgoing network traffic.\n\n**Recommended Configuration:**\n\n* ✅ UFW should be installed\n* ✅ UFW should be active\n* ✅ Default incoming policy should be set to 'deny'\n* ✅ Only necessary ports should be opened\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  **Important: Docker Bypasses UFW Rules**\n\nDocker directly modifies `iptables` rules, which means it bypasses UFW firewall rules. This is a critical security issue: **ports exposed by Docker containers remain accessible from the public internet even when UFW rules should block them**, creating a false sense of security.\n\nFor example, if you have UFW configured to deny all incoming traffic by default, but you run a Docker container with `-p 3000:3000`, port 3000 will still be accessible from the internet despite your UFW configuration.\n\n* **ufw-docker**: Use the [ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) utility to properly integrate Docker with UFW, ensuring that Docker containers respect UFW firewall rules.\n\n* **VPS Provider Firewall**: Configure your cloud provider's firewall (e.g., AWS Security Groups, DigitalOcean Firewalls) to block public access to Docker-exposed ports. This operates before Docker's iptables rules and provides reliable protection.\n</Callout>\n\nSecure Shell (SSH) configuration is crucial for safe remote server access.\n\n* ✅ SSH service should be enabled\n* ✅ Key-based authentication should be enabled\n* ❌ Password authentication should be disabled\n* ❌ PAM should be disabled when using key-based authentication\n* ✅ Use non-standard SSH port (optional)\n\n### Fail2Ban Protection\n\nFail2Ban helps prevent brute force attacks by temporarily banning IPs that show malicious behavior.\n\n**Recommended Setup:**\n\n* ✅ Fail2Ban should be installed\n* ✅ Service should be enabled and running\n* ✅ SSH protection should be enabled\n* ✅ Use aggressive mode for enhanced security\n\n## Security Status Check\n\nDokploy automatically validates these security configurations and provides recommendations:\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/server-security.png\" alt=\"Security\" width={1000} height={600} />\n\nThese security measures are essential baseline recommendations. Depending on your specific use case, additional security measures might be necessary.",
