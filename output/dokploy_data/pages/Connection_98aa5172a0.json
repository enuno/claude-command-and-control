Ensure the external port is available and not in conflict with other services.\n2. Enter the external port you wish to use to expose your database.\n3. The system will automatically generate an external connection URL, which can be used to access the database from any database management tool over the internet, like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, PgAdmin, etc.\n\nFor security reasons, internal credentials should be used for applications running within the same network or environment to prevent unauthorized access. External credentials should only be used when necessary and with proper security measures in place, such as VPNs or IP whitelisting.",
