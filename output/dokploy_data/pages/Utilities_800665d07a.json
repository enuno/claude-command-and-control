  "content": "Dokploy provides a set of utilities to enhance your Docker Compose application deployment experience.\n\n## Isolated Deployments\n\nAll open source templates come with this feature enabled by default.\n\nThis feature allows you to deploy your application in a separate network, isolated from other applications. This isolation is particularly useful when you need to deploy multiple instances of the same application.\n\nFor example, if you want to deploy two WordPress instances, you would typically encounter service naming conflicts since they share the same network (dokploy-network). Docker doesn't allow services with identical names in the same network. Consider this typical WordPress service:\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/compose-isolate.png\" alt=\"Isolated Deployments\" width={1000} height={600} />\n\nWhen Isolated Deployments is enabled, Dokploy will:\n\n1. Create a network based on your `appName` and associate it with each service in your compose file\n2. Add the network to every service in your compose file\n3. Connect the Traefik load balancer to this isolated network, maintaining service isolation while ensuring proper routing\n\nWhen using this feature, you don't need to explicitly define dokploy-network in your networks section, as isolation is handled automatically.\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  **Important: Installation Type Considerations**\n\nIf you're using a **custom installation** that replaces the standalone Traefik container with a Docker service (see [Manual Installation](/docs/core/manual-installation)), be aware of the following risks:\n\n1. **System Restart Issues**: If your system restarts, your services may lose their network references to Traefik. This happens because Docker Swarm changes network references after a restart, which can cause connectivity issues between your services and Traefik.\n\n2. **Manual Redeployment Required**: After a system restart, you may need to manually redeploy your Docker Compose applications to restore network connectivity, which can be tedious and time-consuming.\n\n3. **Reference**: For more details about this issue, see [GitHub Issue #1004](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/issues/1004).\n\n**Recommended Approach**: If you use the **official installation** or **manual installation with the standalone Traefik container**, you won't experience these issues. Your services should start normally after a system restart without requiring manual intervention.\n</Callout>",
