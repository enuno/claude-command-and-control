INTEGRATION FAILURE REASON

File: software-architecture/SKILL.md
Date: 2025-12-26T08:35 UTC
Status: DUPLICATE

Issue:
This file is a duplicate of the software-architecture skill that was already integrated
in the previous integration session (commit b0f4be3 on 2025-12-26).

Additional Issue:
The file is in HTML format (204K HTML document) rather than markdown format.
It appears to be a downloaded GitHub webpage instead of the actual skill file.

Existing Skill Location:
skills-templates/software-architecture/SKILL.md (already integrated and documented)

Action Taken:
Moved to INTEGRATION/failed/software-architecture-duplicate-html/

Recommendation:
No action needed - skill already exists in repository.
If update is needed, modify the existing file directly in skills-templates/.
