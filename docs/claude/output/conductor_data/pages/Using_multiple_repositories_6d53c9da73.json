If you have other questions or feedback about using multiple repositories in Conductor, please reach out to us at [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build).\n\nTo link multiple directories together in Conductor, we recommend:\n\n1. Add each directory to Conductor\n2. Create a workspace for each directory\n3. In one workspace, enter `/add-dir` and select the other workspaces you'd like to link together.\n\n<img alt=\"Add directory\" />\n\nNow, agents in this workspace will be able to access files and code from the other linked workspaces.\n\n## Running Multiple Services at Once\n\nTo run multiple services from different repositories at once, we recommend creating a [run script](/core/scripts#run-script) for each repository.",
