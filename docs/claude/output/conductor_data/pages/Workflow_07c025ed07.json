This allows you to create a workspace from a pull request, branch, or Linear issue.\n\n<img alt=\"Workflow\" />\n\nUse Claude Code directly in Conductor, or open the workspace in your favorite IDE to make edits.\n\n<img alt=\"Open in IDE\" />\n\n## Review and test changes\n\nReview changes in the Diff Viewer (⌘D). Use the Terminal or Run panel to test changes.\n\nSee [this guide](/guides/how-to-run) for more on how to run your web server or app server within a workspace.\n\nCreate a PR (⌘⇧P). If any checks fail, Conductor will help you fix them.\n\nOnce everything looks good, merge!\n\n<img alt=\"Repository details\" />\n\nWhen you're done working on that feature, archive the workspace. You can always restore the workspace later — including your chat history — from the repository details page.",
