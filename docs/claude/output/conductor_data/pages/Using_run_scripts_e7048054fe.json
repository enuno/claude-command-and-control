Conductor allocates ten ports to each workspace (`$CONDUCTOR_PORT` through `$CONDUCTOR_PORT+9`).\n\n## Nonconcurrent mode\n\nIf you can't run multiple dev servers at once, use `nonconcurrent` mode. In this mode, whenever you click the run button, Conductor will kill any in-progress run scripts before starting the new one.\n\nFor more details about how run scripts work, see [Scripts](/core/scripts).",
