  "content": "Source: https://docs.conductor.build/tips/migration-conductor-json\n\n<img alt=\"Migration conductor.json\" />\n\nTo make it easier to share configurations, as of version 0.11.0, we store your setup and run scripts in a `conductor.json` file.\n\nIf you had previously added scripts using the UI, when you upgrade you'll see a new workspace called \"Migrate conductor.json\".\n\nIn the migration workspace:\n\n1. Click \"Create migration PR\"\n2. Merge it\n\nIn the PR, Conductor has written your existing scripts into a new `conductor.json` file. (If you see any other changes in the PR, consider removing them before merging.)\n\nA few seconds after you merge, your other workspaces will be able to use scripts again. For more on how this works, see [conductor.json precedence](/tips/scripts#conductor-json-precedence).\n\nIf you run into any issues with the migration, reach out to us at [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build).\n\n## Alternative: local conductor.json\n\nIf you'd rather not commit conductor.json, you can follow these steps instead:\n\n1. Go to the repository settings page (click the repo name in the left sidebar)\n2. Choose \"Open In\" to open the repository root directory in Finder or an IDE\n3. Create a `conductor.json` file\n\nIf you had trouble with the migration, try clicking on the repo name in the sidebar and opening the \"Debug your conductor.json migration\" section.\n\nOr, send us an email at [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build)",
