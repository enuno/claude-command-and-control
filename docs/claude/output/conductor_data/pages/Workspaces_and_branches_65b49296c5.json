When you start your first chat, Conductor will instruct the agent to rename this branch to match what you're working on.\n\n### Switching branches\n\nIf what you're working on changes, you can check out a different branch:\n\n...or rename the current branch:\n\n...or create a new branch:\n\n### Starting from an existing branch\n\nIf you have an existing branch and you want to start a new workspace from it, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or click the `...` icon next to the \"New workspace\" button\n2. Choose the \"Branches\" tab and select a branch\n\nYou could also create a new workspace and then switch to the branch you want using the instructions in the \"Switching branches\" section above.\n\n### One workspace per branch\n\nA branch can only be checked out in one workspace at a time.\n\nIf you want to check out the `scroll-to-bottom-btn` branch in `tokyo`, but you already have\nthat branch checked out in `warsaw`, try one of these:\n\n* In `tokyo`, run `git checkout -b scroll-to-bottom-btn-2 scroll-to-bottom-btn` to create a new branch based off of `scroll-to-bottom-btn`\n* In `warsaw`, switch to any other branch (e.g., `git checkout -b dummy`), then in `tokyo` run `git checkout scroll-to-bottom-btn`",
