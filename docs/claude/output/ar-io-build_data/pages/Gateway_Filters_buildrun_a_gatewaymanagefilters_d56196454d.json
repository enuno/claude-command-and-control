  "content": "Configure your AR.IO Gateway to efficiently process and index only the data you need. This comprehensive guide covers advanced filtering techniques, performance optimization, and real-world use cases.\n\nThe AR.IO Gateway uses a flexible JSON-based filtering system to control data processing and indexing. The system provides precise control over which bundles are processed and which data items are indexed for querying.\n\n## Understanding the Filtering System\n\nThe AR.IO Gateway uses two primary filters to control data processing:\n\n1. **ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER** - Controls which bundles are processed and unbundled\n2. **ANS104_INDEX_FILTER** - Controls which data items from unbundled bundles are indexed for querying\n\nBy default, gateways process no bundles and index no data items. You must\n  explicitly configure filters to start processing data.\n\n## Core Environment Variables\n\n### Configure Data Management\n\nOptimize data storage and processing:",
