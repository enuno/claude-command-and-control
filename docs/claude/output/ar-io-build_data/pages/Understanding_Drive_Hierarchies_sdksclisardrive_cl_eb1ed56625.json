  "content": "At the root of every data tree is a \"Drive\" entity. When a drive is created, a Root Folder is also created for it. The entity IDs for both are generated and returned when you create a new drive:\n\nThe relationship between the drive and its root folder is clearly visible when retrieving the drive's info:\n\nAll file and folder entities in the drive will be anchored to it by a \"Drive-ID\" GQL Tag. And they'll each be anchored to a parent folder ID, tracked via the \"Parent-Folder-ID\" GQL tag, forming a tree structure whose base terminates at the Root Folder.",
