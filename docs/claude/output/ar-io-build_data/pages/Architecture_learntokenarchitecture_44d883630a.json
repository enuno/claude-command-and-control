  "content": "## ARIO Contract Architecture\n\nThe $ARIO token operates through a smart contract built on AO Computer. The system is composed of several interconnected components that work together to provide a comprehensive network infrastructure.\n\n### Balances\nThe Balances component manages the fundamental token accounting for the ARIO ecosystem:\n\n- **Token Holdings**: Tracks ARIO token balances for all network participants\n- **Transfer Logic**: Handles secure token transfers between addresses\n- **Paginated Queries**: Provides efficient balance lookups with cursor-based pagination\n- **Integration Layer**: Connects with all other components for balance updates\n\n### Gateway Registry\nThe Gateway Registry manages the network's infrastructure providers and all delegation relationships:\n\n- **Gateway Management**: Handles gateway registration, settings updates, and network participation\n- **Operator Stakes**: Manages gateway operator stakes and minimum staking requirements\n- **Delegated Stakes**: Coordinates delegated stake from token holders to gateway operators\n- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors gateway performance metrics and eligibility for rewards\n\n### ArNS Registry\nThe ArNS (Arweave Name System) Registry provides decentralized domain name services:\n\n- **Name Registration**: Manages the purchase and registration of friendly names\n- **Lease Management**: Handles name renewals and lease extensions\n- **Primary Names**: Allows users to set primary names for their addresses\n- **ANT Integration**: Links registered names to their corresponding ANT processes\n\n### Vaults\nThe Vaults component implements token time-locking mechanisms for various ecosystem purposes:\n\n- **Multi-Purpose Locking**: Locks tokens for RFPs, bug bounties, investors, and core team members\n- **Flexible Terms**: Supports various lock periods and amounts based on purpose and requirements\n- **Extension Options**: Allows participants to extend vault lock periods when needed\n- **Withdrawal Logic**: Manages secure token release after lock expiration or completion of terms\n\n### ANT Registry Process\nA utility process that facilitates ANT discovery and management:\n\n- **Discovery Service**: Makes it easy to find ANTs owned by specific wallet addresses\n- **Ownership Tracking**: Provides efficient lookup of ANT ownership relationships\n- **Integration Support**: Connects with wallets and dApps for seamless ANT management\n- **Query Interface**: Enables paginated queries for ANT discovery\n\n### ArNS Name Tokens (ANTs)\nTransferable token processes that represent ownership and control of ArNS names:\n\n- **Name Ownership**: Each ANT process controls a specific ArNS name\n- **Record Management**: ANT holders manage DNS-like records for their names\n- **Undername Control**: Support for creating and managing subdomains (undernames)\n- **Transferable Rights**: ANTs can be bought, sold, and transferred as independent tokens\n- **Process-Based**: Each ANT is its own AO process with autonomous functionality\n\nThe architecture implements multiple layers of security:\n\n### Economic Security\n- **Stake Requirements**: Minimum stakes ensure operator commitment and skin in the game\n- **Performance-Based Removal**: Gateways that fail observation for 30 consecutive epochs are removed from the network\n- **Complete Stake Slashing**: 100% of stake is returned to the protocol balance when gateways are removed for poor performance\n- **Observation Consensus**: Peer-to-peer monitoring ensures no single point of failure in performance evaluation\n\n### Technical Security\n- **AO Computer**: Leverages Arweave's permanent and decentralized compute layer\n- **Process Isolation**: Separate processes for different system functions\n- **Cryptographic Verification**: All transactions and state changes are cryptographically secured\n\n### Governance Security\n- **Current Ownership**: Currently owned by a multisig with intentions to make ownership immutable\n- **Path to Immutability**: Plans to transition to fully immutable protocol without governance control\n- **Transparent Operations**: All system state is publicly verifiable on Arweave\n- **Consensus-Based Evaluation**: Gateway performance determined by peer consensus rather than centralized authority",
