  "content": "Upload data to Arweave using **Turbo** - the most reliable way to upload data to Arweave. Turbo provides enterprise-grade infrastructure with flexible payment options and optimized performance.\n\nTurbo is a ultrahigh-throughput Permaweb service that streamlines the funding, indexing, and transmission of data to and from Arweave. It provides graphical and programmatic interfaces for payment options in fiat currency with credit or debit cards as well as cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, USDC, and AR. It integrates two key components: a service that bundles uploads for efficiency and ease, and a payment system designed for straightforward transactions. Turbo Credits, which users can purchase within the ArDrive web app, the [Turbo Top Up App](https://turbo-topup.com/), or by using the [Turbo SDK/CLI](/sdks/turbo-sdk), have the same storage purchasing power of AR tokens, along with the additional benefits provided by Turbo. These credits are meticulously calibrated, with the Winston Credit (winc) representing the smallest unit, ensuring users have precise control over their storage needs. As an open-source technology, Turbo encourages community engagement, allowing developers to contribute to its continuous enhancement.\n\n### Set Up Your Wallet\n\nCreate a new wallet or use an existing one:",
