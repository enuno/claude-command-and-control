  "content": "Using the custom content type feature, it is possible for users to upload their own custom manifests. The Arweave gateways use this special content type in order to identify an uploaded file as a manifest:\n\nIn addition to this content type, the manifest must also adhere to the [correct JSON structure](#manifest-json) of an Arweave manifest. A user can create their own manifest from scratch, or start by piping a generated manifest to a JSON file and editing it to their specifications:\n\nAfter editing the generated manifest, simply perform an `upload-file` command with the custom Arweave manifest content type to any PUBLIC folder:\n\nThe returned `dataTxId` field on the created `file` entity will be the endpoint that the manifest can be found on Arweave, just as explained in the [manifest sections](#uploading-manifests) above:",
