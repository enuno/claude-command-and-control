We currently do not support non-root deployments.\n</Callout>\n\n<Callout type=\"warning\">\n  If your remote server is configured with a different shell (other than bash), you must configure bash as the default shell, as Dokploy has been developed and tested with bash.\n</Callout>\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/server-deploy.png\" alt=\"Remote Server Setup\" width={1000} height={600} />\n\nWe provide two main actions to configure your server:\n\n* **Modify Script**: Allows you to view and customize the installation script that will be executed on your server. You can adjust it according to your specific needs.\n* **Setup Server**: Initiates the configuration process on the remote server. When clicked, it will open a modal window showing real-time logs of the script execution.\n\nExample of the server setup logs:\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/server-drawer.png\" alt=\"Remote Server Setup\" width={1000} height={600} />",
