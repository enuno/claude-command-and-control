Let's suppose you have a `application` in this way:\n\nRepository: `my-app`\nBranch: `feature`\n\nIf you try to make a push on another branch eg. `main`, Dokploy will not automatically deploy your application, because\nyour application have selected `feature` as the Branch.\n\n<Callout>\n  In the case you want to have multiple applications in the same repository, eg. (development, staging, production), you can create 3 `Applications` in Dokploy\n  and select the branch in each of them.\n\nThis is very usefull if you want to have multiple environments for the same application.\n</Callout>",
