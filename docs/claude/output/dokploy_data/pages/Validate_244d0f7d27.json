The validation requirements differ between **Deployment Servers** and **Build Servers**.\n\n## Deployment Servers\n\nFor **Deployment Servers**, Dokploy requires the following 7 components to be properly configured:\n\n1. **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed on the remote server.\n2. **RClone Installed**: RClone must be installed on the remote server.\n3. **Nixpacks Installed**: Nixpacks must be installed on the remote server.\n4. **Railpack Installed**: Railpack must be installed on the remote server.\n5. **Buildpacks Installed**: Buildpacks must be installed on the remote server.\n6. **Docker Swarm Initialized**: Docker Swarm must be initialized on the remote server.\n7. **Dokploy Network Created**: A Docker network for Dokploy must be created on the remote server.\n8. **Main Directory Created**: A directory must be created on the remote server to store applications.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  Deployment servers are used to run and host your applications. They require Docker Swarm and network configuration since they need to run containers and manage deployments.\n</Callout>\n\nFor **Build Servers**, Dokploy only validates the following components:\n\n1. **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed on the remote server.\n2. **RClone Installed**: RClone must be installed on the remote server.\n3. **Nixpacks Installed**: Nixpacks must be installed on the remote server.\n4. **Railpack Installed**: Railpack must be installed on the remote server.\n5. **Buildpacks Installed**: Buildpacks must be installed on the remote server.\n6. **Main Directory Created**: A directory must be created on the remote server to store applications.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  Build servers are dedicated to building and compiling applications. They don't require Docker Swarm or network configuration since they only build images and push them to a registry, without running any containers.\n</Callout>\n\nOnce all requirements are met for your server type, you will see a green checkmark next to each item in the validation section.\n\n<ImageZoom src=\"/assets/images/server-validate.png\" alt=\"Multi-Server Setup\" width={1000} height={600} />",
