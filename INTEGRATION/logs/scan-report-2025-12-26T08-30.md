### Other (1 directory - requires review)

#### 3. software-architecture ⚠️ **DUPLICATE - HTML FILE**
- **Path**: INTEGRATION/incoming/software-architecture/
- **Main File**: SKILL.md (204K)
- **Modified**: December 26, 2025
- **File Type**: **HTML document** (NOT markdown)
- **Issue**: This appears to be an HTML webpage, possibly a downloaded GitHub page
- **Status**: ⚠️ **Duplicate of existing skill**
- **Action Required**:
  - This skill already exists in skills-templates/software-architecture/
  - File is HTML, not markdown format
  - Should be removed or moved to failed/
  - If needed, extract actual markdown content from the HTML

**Analysis**:
The file starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and contains GitHub CSS/styling. This is likely a web page that was saved instead of the raw markdown file. The actual software-architecture skill was already integrated in the previous session (see commit b0f4be3).

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Required)

1. **Process Ready Skills** (2 directories):
   ```bash
   /integration-process
   ```
   This will move pict-test-designer-minimal and prompt-engineering to skills-templates/

2. **Handle Duplicate**:
   ```bash
   # Move software-architecture to failed with explanation
   mkdir -p INTEGRATION/failed/software-architecture-duplicate-html
   mv INTEGRATION/incoming/software-architecture/* INTEGRATION/failed/software-architecture-duplicate-html/
   echo "Duplicate of existing skill (already in skills-templates/). File is HTML format, not markdown." > INTEGRATION/failed/software-architecture-duplicate-html/REASON.txt
   ```

3. **Validate Integration** (After processing):
   ```bash
   /integration-validate
   ```
   Run comprehensive QA on the 2 newly integrated skills

4. **Update Documentation** (After validation):
   ```bash
   /integration-update-docs
   ```
   Add 2 new skills to README.md and skills-templates/README.md

### Follow-Up Actions (Recommended)

5. **Review Installation Requirements**:
   - pict-test-designer requires PICT tool installation
   - Update README-INSTALL.txt if needed
   - Consider adding to global setup documentation

6. **Test New Skills**:
   - Try pict-test-designer on a real test case design scenario
   - Use prompt-engineering to optimize an existing command or skill
   - Verify reference documentation is accessible and accurate

7. **Categorization Update**:
   - Add "Testing/QA" category to skills-templates/README.md
   - Update Meta category to "Meta/Development" (now includes 4 skills)
