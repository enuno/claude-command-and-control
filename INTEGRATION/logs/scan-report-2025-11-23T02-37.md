## Recommended Next Steps

### All Files Ready for Integration ✅

All 6 skill files have passed validation and are ready to be integrated:

1. **Run integration-process** (when implemented):
   ```
   /integration-process
   ```
   This will:
   - Move files to `skills-templates/` or appropriate skill directory
   - Rename if needed to match naming conventions
   - Create metadata records

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Add skills to README.md skills table
   - Update skills/README.md index
   - Document in CLAUDE.md if needed

3. **Create Skill Directories** (recommended structure):
   ```
   skills/content-research-writer/SKILL.md
   skills/root-cause-tracing/SKILL.md
   skills/sharing-skills/SKILL.md
   skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md
   skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md
   skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md
   ```

## Skill Themes Identified

The incoming skills fall into three categories:

### 1. Development Workflow Skills (3 files)
- **using-git-worktrees** - Workspace isolation
- **subagent-driven-development** - Plan execution with subagents
- **root-cause-tracing** - Debugging methodology

### 2. Contribution & Sharing Skills (1 file)
- **sharing-skills** - Contributing skills upstream

### 3. Content & Meta Skills (2 files)
- **content-research-writer** - Writing assistance
- **using-superpowers** - Meta-skill for skill system usage

**Observation**: Strong coverage of development workflows. The `using-superpowers` skill is particularly important as it establishes mandatory patterns for skill discovery and usage.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ All files validated and ready
2. Create individual skill directories in `skills/` directory
3. Move each file to `skills/[skillname]/SKILL.md`
4. Update README.md with skill descriptions
5. Test each skill with real scenarios

### Naming Convention Note
Current files use uppercase naming (e.g., `USING-SUPERPOWERS-SKILL.md`). Repository convention appears to use lowercase with hyphens for directories and `SKILL.md` for the actual skill file. Recommend:
- `USING-SUPERPOWERS-SKILL.md` → `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`

### Priority Order for Integration
1. **using-superpowers** (meta-skill, needed by all others)
2. **using-git-worktrees** (foundation for isolated work)
3. **subagent-driven-development** (plan execution)
4. **root-cause-tracing** (debugging)
5. **sharing-skills** (contribution)
6. **content-research-writer** (writing assistance)
