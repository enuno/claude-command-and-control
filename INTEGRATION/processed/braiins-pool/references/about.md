# Braiins Pool

Braiins Pool is the oldest active bitcoin mining pool in the world, having mined its first block in 2010. It was originally known as "bitcoin.cz" and "Slush Pool" before being renamed to Braiins Pool in 2022.

The primary function of a bitcoin mining pool is to enable miners who participate in it to earn more consistent and stable rewards by aggregating their individual computing power (called hashpower) with that of all the other miners in the pool.

Increasing the cumulative hashpower and market share of the pool increases the frequency with which the pool finds blocks and earns revenue.

The pool operator then splits the revenue proportionally amongst all its participants according to the percentage of the pools total hashpower that each contributed.
