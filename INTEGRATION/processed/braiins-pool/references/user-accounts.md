## User account guide

### Account registration

Anonymity is one of the core values deeply rooted in our philosophy. Therefore, we do not collect nor process any unnecessary personal data, making our registration process reasonably simple.

You only need to fill in basic information such as your desired username, e-mail address, and password on the sign-up page. Then, confirm the registration process by clicking on the link sent to your email address.

### Access profiles

In Settings > Access Profiles, there is an option to create various access profiles with different passwords and with different levels of permission to your account. Just click +Create New and choose from the list of possibilities.

### Access permissions

Choose between granting full access or just read-only access to a selected profile. If you, for example, run a larger mining operation and do not want some users to change these settings, granular permissions are a great feature for you.

**Allow access to web APIs**: The user will be able to use token authentication in scripts or 3rd party applications. You can generate new tokens there.

**Allow website login**: The user will be able to access the main account on the website using the access profile name you choose (in `accessProfileName@userName` format) and password you set right there.

**Allow watcher link access**: Anyone will be able to access the main account without needing to log in to the website by using a generated web link.

### Account security

We highly recommend activating two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to your account. It can be done in the Settings > Security menu. After the initial setup, you will need to use the 2FA every time when making any important changes to your account.

You can either use 2FA based on the TOTP standard (mobile TOTP app is used to generate the verification code) or the more advanced U2F standard (via a hardware device/token like Trezor).

### Username change

Changing the username is currently not allowed. You can, however, create a new account with a different username under the same email address. Having multiple accounts registered with the same email address is possible.

### Account deletion

If you decide to close down your mining operation, there are two options. You can either leave your account as it is without signing into it or mining with it and the account will be automatically deleted after one year of your inactivity. The remaining balance will be considered as a donation to the pool.

However, if you decide to delete the account immediately, please always check if all rewards have already been paid to your payout address before taking any action. Then, request account deletion in the Settings > Accounts menu and confirm it via the confirmation link sent to your email.

## Account

All of the crucial information related to language, emails, and account settings can be found by clicking on the user icon in the upper right corner and then choosing Account.

Once you are redirected to the account page, the very first thing that will popup is the theme change option.

Moving on you can find the email setting, where you can change the user email address.

Additionally, you can find language, time zone and currency changes which can be set to your liking and preferences.

Lastly, is the account deletion section, where you can make a request to delete the account and will be prompted to request for a final payout to not lose any of your finances, given that the action is immediate.

## Security

Under the user icon in the upper right hand corner you can find the security section.

Once you click on it you will get redirected and right off the bat you will see the password reset option which is pretty standard.

Under the password reset settings you will find the two factor authentication which is both encouraged and highly recommended to prevent any unauthorized changes when someone else would obtain access to your account.

First option is OTP and second is FIDO.

Lastly in the case you want to take quick and agile measures you have the option to log out all active users by pressing the logout all sessions button.

If you experience any issues or have lost access to your OTP application, please contact our support team as soon as possible - prompt requests have a higher probability to be resolved to your satisfaction.

## Access Profiles & Watcher Links

One cool feature of Braiins Pool that you can find in the user section is the Access profiles.

It is pretty standard for multiple users to have access to one account when it comes to Bitcoin mining, however it's not always the case that the different users share the same level of responsibility and therefore their access can be limited.

It is also desired to share the web link for anonymous access, known as a watcher link.

This is how you can share access to your Braiins Pool account with others.

By clicking the create new button, we can create a new access profile with 3 different access types: login, API, or watcher link, each using up to 3 levels of permissions: full, read only, or limited read only.

Each one of those levels can be described in the permissions overview can be set according to the given function, while keeping the master account intact.

## History

In order to export Braiins Pool history, you need to navigate to the history section from the dashboard.

After you reach the history section you will see the export button in the upper right corner, once you click that you'll get a popup with several options of how you can customize your export.

The first thing that needs to be set is a date range of which you want to get the history.

Then you can choose what type records you want to export based on your overall needs.

And lastly you can choose the format in which you want the data to be exported.

Once all of that is done you can hit the generate exports button and receive the list in the format you opted for.

Please note that you can not export hashrate related data directly from the web interface. However, you can use our extensive API documentation to collect data directly. If you have any questions regarding API set up, please do not hesitate and contact our support team.
